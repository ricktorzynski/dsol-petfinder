The result was this little kitty. I do not have enough space and funds to care for more cats in my household. Looking for responsible people to take over Nibble's care.\n",

      "Charlie was rescued by dogs! A friend was walking his dogs when they suddenly became excited outside an apartment complex and sniffed out a shoe box. Inside the shoe box was little Charlie! He was about 6 weeks old then, emaciated and dehydrated, just a scrap of skin and bones. He had a bad tummy virus but survived it after two weeks of antibiotics. Now he needs a permanent home! Charlie is very active, playful, and affectionate. He likes playing with other cats and sitting on people's laps. He uses his litterbox without fail. Charlie is best suited for indoor living, free-roaming inside a house or apartment. Adoption Procedure: - We'll have a chat and see if you and Charlie are suitable for each other. Then you can meet and see if you get along :) - Successful adopter will then have to meet us at my vet in order to get the little tyke vaccinated. Then your new family member is yours to take home and love forever. - Cost of vaccinations and neutering to be borne by adopter. I am primarily an independent rescuer/fosterer. My funds are extremely limited. - I do appreciate occasional updates and photos after a successful adoption! Vaccinations and neutering at 6 months of age are COMPULSORY for adoption. There are already too many stray homeless animals starving and suffering in the streets.. Look how Charlie started out! Please don't breed. When you want more pets, you can always ADOPT from a shelter. No cage confinement please, except in incidences of illness or injury. Imagine how bored, restless, and angry you'd be if you were locked up all the time. Prison is punishment! Interested parties can text or email me. An introduction of yourself, your experience with cats, and your approach to their care is greatly appreciated. Serious inquiries from responsible cat lovers only please. I want Charlie to be loved his whole life :)\n",
      "I am posting this on my lecturer's behalf. She found this stray dog in her neighbourhood at Sungai Buloh. He was terrified of people but gradually warmed up to her after she fed him some food & he would wait outside her house at the same time every day for food. One day he didn't show up. When he finally showed up again, he had a large terrible wound on his neck. He was in so much pain and had tears in his eyes. She brought him to the vet and found out his wound had become infested with maggots. The vet treated him and she brought him home and nursed him back to health for over a month. The wound has now completely healed but unfortunately she is unable to keep him. He is estimated to be 10 years old but is still strong & healthy. We are unsure about his breed. He is very obedient & easy to care for. This precious angel has gone through a lot & really needs a loving home.\n",

      "I am looking for a loving permanent home for Kaiser. Kaiser is a really amazing, sweet and funny dog. He is very loving and affectionate, who loves and NEEDS attention. He needs someone that will treat him like part of the family and the sweet dog he is. He grew up with 2 cats and another small dog. he loves cats however it takes him awhile to respond well to new dogs. He never really socialized with children before, so if you have kids I would suggest meeting Kaiser with them before making a decision.He grew up mostly as an indoor dog but can do well outside if there is a shady place for him to relax during the hot parts of the day. NO Cage, No chain! please note that Kaiser is a family pet not guard dog. Kaiser is a pure breed rottweiler, he has his MKA certificate, basic dog obedience training certificate and a good citizens award metal. He also knows almost all the tricks: sit, stay, shake etc.and is a super fast learner. The reason I have to give him up for adaption is, Im an expat who was living in Malaysia for 5 years, I had to leave and unfortunately I was unable to take Kaiser with me (his breed was band in the country I moved to). I'm looking for someone to give him a permanent loving home. Kaiser is one of those dogs that crave that best friend relationship with his owner. so if you think he sounds like a good match for you please email me. my number is not available as I am out of the country, Kaiser is staying with my friend in Selangor for now.\n",

      "When I search through the cats on petfinder for adoption, my heart sank as most cats are cuter, younger and prettier than Ninja. Though I personal understand that chances of him being adopted is as close as 0, but deep down inside me I still hope someone who will have a big heart for him. Ninja is not special or pretty, but in my eyes, he is not any lesser than other prettier cats. He is 6-year-old now, and has never parted with me as he was born in my wardrobe and been with me since then. His mom was a stray that I used to feed and without me knowing she creeped into my wardrobe and gave birth to 3 beautiful babies. Unfortunately his mom passed away after 2 weeks, sent to the vet when found she Ill but was too late to treat. I bottle fed him since the day his mom crossed the bridge. I have 4 cats of my own and I'm being relocated to SG and could only bring 2 cats with me due to circumstances. I would eventually follow my husband to Australia in a few years time from SG and can't afford the expensive pet relocating cost. It kills me to pick which 2 among 4 of them. I'm brining the oldest and Ninja's sister (ex-sporo survival) simply because 1 being the oldest and the other one being an ex sporo patient. Ninja is a very quiet and independent cat. He doesn't like to be held much or pat. It takes a really big heart to love him unconditionally as he is not the huggable type. He needs a permanent home with an owner who loves him despite being a little too 'cool'. I hope someone out there will have a space at home and a big heart to take him in and love him. Anyone who likes to find out more about Ninja may drop me messages on whatsapp at (Michelle)\n",

      "THE PLIGHT OF OREO Oreo was approximate 3 years old when found on the side of the road in Seri kembangan, Selangor. With broken hind legs. Probably knocked by a vehicle. He was crying but no passer-by cared to rescue him. My friends from the neigbourhood and I decided to check him out after hearing his cry for a couple of days and noticed that he was an abandoned puppy with serious injuries. We quickly raised funds ourselves and sent him to the vet for operations. Now, he is as healthy and lively as any other puppy. Soon after he was healed, we put his up for adoption as my friend's parents strongly against her keeping \"Oreo\" as pet. Finally, a kind lady adopted \"Oreo\" but only for 2 weeks. She surrendered Oreo to us saying the dog is just not right for her and Oreo has lost because she was careless . Finally my friend get to found \"Oreo\" in some where. Now, we have to put Oreo up for adoption again. I really hope that a kind person with love and care for animals will adopt Oreo and give him a comfortable live. He has gone through many hardship. From being abandoned to severe injuries, then adopted to be abandoned again. If you are touched and would love to keep Oreo, a lively and active puppy of 3 years old ,please call at Shirmy or Yeng Tian . Every dog, including Oreo deserves a second chance. * Please note that the photography of Oreo was done FOC by a kind photographer, Andrew 洋葱头, who pitied the plight of Oreo\n",

      "Hi, A beautiful, fun, loving, clever and handsome boy up for adoption. Boy has a beautiful coat and googly eyes. Meet Bidi Budu Bubu Boy. He was rescued on May 14th from the dog catcher. The rescuer took him back from the pound less than 4 hours he was sent there. He was destined for a forever home. Unfortunately, the adopters don't want him anymore and due to his nature of lovingness, he can't be left at the road side. Nobody will ever know the boy's history but am sure he went through some bad times in order for him to be caught by the dog catches. The Bidi Budu Bubu Boy is well-behaved, doesn't bark unnecessarily, doesn't mess up the garden, bite shoes or any of that sorts. So, whatever may be, you will end up with a loving darling of a boy. Please provide a loving home for him as he will make you a very happy person. Ps. Would prefer people who allow us visitation rights as we want to ensure the puppies are taken care off. Pss. Spaying & vaccination all will be done by this week. Boy is adoptable in 3 weeks.\n",

She has been given a second chance and restored to good health. She is affectionate and friendly with humans and would make a nice backyard or inside/outside pet. It is tough giving homes to older cats, but on the plus side, she is past the destructive kitten phase and has already proven to be a very social and easygoing cat with lots of personality. She would blend right in if you can make room for her. She has really unusual markings that remind me of a cup of an iced mocha.\n",

Two months ago she was rescued from the streets, as she was malnourished, suffering from cat flu and heavily pregnant. The tablets prescribed by the vet to treat her caused a miscarriage but perhaps that was the universe saying she was too small to give birth. Since then she has been treated for cat flu and has been spayed. She has also had her vaccinations and been dewormed.

      "Adoption fee includes the basic medical expenses of the animal : spaying + 3 vaccinations. GERBERA is a tropical plant of the daisy family, native to Asia and Africa, with large brightly colored flowers. Just like this little kitten that we are fostering - Gerbera, she is as beautiful as the flower. Gerbera was rescued months ago at a food court, she was only a 2 months old baby during that time. Poor little baby was hiding under a car and meowing loudly seeking for help as there were a group of excited dogs wanted to hunt her and they kept running and waiting around the car. With help of some kind people there, we managed to shooed those doggie away and brought her home. Gerbera loves a lot to have companion and friends, she do not like much to be cuddled but she will always stay beside you and ask for a pat and \"massage\", she lovesss a lot when people sayang her. Gerbera is always happy when we're back home, she will always purr when we're at her side. But Gerbera has a habit and we do not know why she has such habit..most of the time when we stand near the window she will quickly run towards the window and climb on the window grill, as if like she's making a performance and telling us that she's good on this (we tried to stop her at the beginning but still..she want to let us know that she's good at this..a spider-cat Gerbera! :P) Gerbera behaves very good on bathing time but she do not like to share her food and toy with her friends. She can eat together with friends if in different bowl but when they re eating same bowl of food, she will be very nervous and lift up her front paw to stop anyone from nearing the bowl but of course she do not bite or hurt anyone.. Interested to adopt? Please kindly read our requirements: - Always keep cat indoor all the time - Agree to bring her for yearly vaccination - Provide balanced meals and fresh water all the time - Allow for home visit - Love and treat her like your own precious family members Please give a home to Gerbera ♥\n",

      "2 little cute puppies are available to be adopted! This two puppies are blood sisters and they are very close to each other. I hope for both of them to get the same adopter so that they won't be separated. The black puppy is jet black in color, including its eyes and paws. Another one is in brown. NOTE: PLZ NEUTER THEM AFTER YOU'VE ADOPTED, so that there'll be less stray dogs in the street. Baby stray dogs is very pityful! Those dogs are abused often and left on the street without proper care. I found them in a park where one of them the forehead was injured by cigarette burn, another one's leg was injured the same - 4 burned mark on it. They were torture seriously by the people around coz they have no owner to take care of them. I've taken them to the clinic and they have recovered from it. They are dewormed and vaccinated first jab. I've been taking care of 8 stray dogs including these two, yet I have to work on day time. It has caused me serious tension and gastric. It's very stressful and I really cant cop with it. I hope that you who interested in adopting them will adopt both of them at once, and give them a loving home.\n",

      "Location: Puchong (Bandar Kinrara) Hi I'm Momo! I'm a highly intelligent kitten that is very attached to people. I love to get myself cosy on people's lap. I'm a curious one, a fast learner and can do many things that young kittens cannot do yet because I am smart! They say I talk(meow) a lot, but I'm just being extra friendly and warm. No worries about my litter, for I am litter-trained.I am also fearless, water shower and hair dryers does not scare me one bit! If you want me to be your companion, I'm available for adoption from January onwards. I am already neutered, vaccined and dewormed by Goh Veterinary. My current owner just needs to make sure that I will be in good hands! Thank you!\n",
      "Ashley and Ginger have been left to fend for themselves by their mummy, who I named Mama Cat. These 2 are her second litter. The first litter have all been adopted by some very generous souls. So these two have been together since birth. They are very playful and friendly, but a bit cautious of strangers. I have been caring for them for the last 5 months and they are both healthy and clean. They are both old enough now to be adopted and hopefully find a loving family. You're more than welcome to adopt one or both, or even if you just want to have a look at them. No hurry at all :)\n",
      "Pooch was found by my mother being kept under very poor conditions in enclosed cement barrel with unsuitable food and no water (only cow's milk which is bad for puppies). Pooch has a bad case of mange and was initially pooping a lot of watery discharge. He was also initially very frightened. He was treated with mange medication for over a month and is now a healthy, happy and very active puppy.

      "Update: 17/8/12 : Lucky is healthy and cured now, she is absolutely ready for a new home.. Please give her a home if you are looking for a new member for your family.. Today morning i rescued a stray from the senai-de saru highway who was probably an accident victim, she was bleeding and could not walk. I brought her to the vet at Global Pets Sdn Bhd in Nusa Bestari Johor Bahru. The vet there examined her and told me her front leg is broken. This is before the xray examination. They also suspect she might have internal injuries as there was bleeding from anus. But, they said at that moment life threatening issue was brain trauma. They are going to give her 10 doses of medication for head trauma for 3 nights and 4 days before further evaluation. I would really appreciate if someone could foster or adopt her after she is discharged.\n",

      "Ponky and his siblings were abandoned at our housing area. He is a healthy, active kitten and very talkative. He is litter tray trained. We are looking for someone to adopt him as we have too many cats. It would be great if the person can also adopt his siblings - Inky and Pinky, although this is not a must. We prefer to give him up to a working Malaysian, no students. We are looking for someone who will vaccinate and neuter him and also take him for regular vet checks. He needs to be kept indoors, as He is very young and would not know how to survive outdoor. Being a new environment, he might also runaway if kept outdoors. He is very good with our cats. Keeping a cat is a commitment for about 15 years and they are children that never grow up and it isn't cheap to keep a pet. Only for serious adopters.\n",

Some videos: Giant and his tennis ball- Giant playing with Snoopy- Giant being bullied- ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ Due to the overwhelming response from my last email (I got close to emails/ sms/ calls), I am sorry but I need to lay down some ground rules. Thank you VERY VERY MUCH in advance for reading this email and forwarding it to your friends and family. Apologies in advance if the terms and conditions set out below are a little \"harsh\", but I have gotten too many emails from very rude people, calls from people who do not even know that it is NOT OK to call people at 2am, etc. Also, our intentions are very simple: WE JUST WANT TO FIND GOOD HOMES FOR THE PUPPIES. 1) Please DO NOT ask me what breed these are, they are stray puppies. If you want a pedigree Siberian Husky, please visit your neighbourhood pet shop. 2) These are large breed dogs, they will grow into a standard size dog. They are not toy dogs, hence not suitable for those who live in an apartment/ condominium. 3) Please DO NOT delete my email with all these information and just forward the photos. I get too many people asking me for information which I have already given in the first place. 4) This email is dated 2 February . This is to manage your expectations on whether the puppy you fell in love with is still available. 5) We reside in Seri Kembangan, KL, near the Astro office (there is someone at home 95% of the time). Please only contact us if you are willing to come to our house to pick the puppies up. It will also mean that we get a chance to meet the new \"owners\" to see whether they are suitable for the puppies. We want to find good homes for the puppies and ensure that they do not get kicked out into the streets once they are grown and lose their cuteness. Those who are interested and agreeable to the above 5 points, please read on: 6) The puppies are free, but as a gesture of sincerity, we hope you can donate RM50 to either SPCA or PAWS. You can pass us the money when you pick up the puppy. We will donate on your behalf and mail you the receipt in your name. If for any reason you cannot afford this token donation, please let us know the reason why, we are very reasonable people. 7) You will need to let us know some basic information about yourself as follows (do include this info in your email): - Name - Where you live and type of house - Who you live with: - Some history on whether you have owned any dogs before 8) No reservations please. First come first served. 9) If your friend/ cousin/ girlfriend/ uncle/ etc is the one interested to adopt, please ask him/ her to contact us directly. It is easier for all this way. 10) If you need clarifications, please call Ryan at.\n",

      "According to the Vet, Coco (d dog) is 7 years old. He was abused by his previous owner by tying him up, day and night; providing very little food, water and shelter. When Coco's testicles became inflammed (not sure how that came about), Coco's prev.owner kicked him out of the house. Coco remained faithful and waited outside the prev.owner's house although with great pain. The prev.owner would then use a cane to whip him and use pesticides to spray onto his inflammed region. My friend saw and rescused the dog. My friend then approached me to foster Coco (to nurse him back to health). My hubby agreed with the condition that Coco to be adopted after he is well and fit as Hubby is not an animal lover. Coco has been with us for slightly over 1 month now. Not only has Coco recovered fully; I have neutered Coco as well as dewormed and vaccinated him. I would like to find a good, loving and nurturing home for Coco as I have promised my hubby earlier on. Coco is a protective but not agressive dog. He is a good family dog and esp loves children. He doesnt bark unncessarily. He is fun loving, active and loveable.

On chilly rainy days or cool humid nights, they share a cozy cage together to huddle up close or to sleep. He has a very good appetite and is always chewing on rawhide. He's a loyal companion, always gentle, yet watchful and observant.

      "Here's Sassy's story. She used to be a stray dog on the streets, she gave birth to a few puppies who died. Opposite the street that she lived in was another female dog and her puppies. Unfortunately this dog died and Sassy decided to feed this new litter of puppies. She was also very protective of this litter of puppies that she whined whenever my dad and I tried to take them away (so sweet right?). She managed to nurture 2 puppies back to health but the rest died. We took her in after a while and she was an amazing pet. She is so tame and was able to learn the rules in our house in no time (much faster than my own dogs). She is loving and a wonderful guard dog. Unfortunately we have to give all our dogs a way. So i hope someone who appreciates a good pet, watchful guard dog and a gentle companion is willing to take her in.\n",

      "Gabby is a beautiful sleek black puppy, estimated to be at 3 months old when she turned up. That was in March . Gabby is a lovely quiet dog that hardly barks. She loves to sit and watch us when we are gardening, or sit with us when we are at ease at the porch area. Our friends who visited us, remarked what a gentle soul Gabby is. The children had no problems playing with her as Gabby is not rough. We have recently had a BBQ party & we've received encouraging remarks that Gabby does not paw, bite or disturb any of the guests when they eat or drink. Gabby was lured to our neighborhood by an irresponsible family who was unable to care for her. We gave our home as Gabby's shelter, in order for Gabby to be safe from traffic, pedestrian abuse and harsh outdoor weather. This beautiful puppy is growing up in our compound and is turning out to be a gentle dog who loves long walks, tummy rubs, sitting with us during evenings, and lots of loving attention. We would like to find Gabby a forever home with a loving family as we are unable to be home at all times. Our job takes us on long outstation trips, and it makes it difficult for us to care for her in the long term. While we are not around, our neighbours are understanding enough to watch over her until we get back. Should anyone be interested in adopting this gentle black female pup, do contact me. I will reply as soon as I am able. FAQs Q : Is Gabby trained in anyway? A : Yes. Gabby's been sent for a Temperament Testing by a professional dog trainer. Gabby is also trained to know Basic Obedience commands (eg; Sit, Stay, Down...etc). Should Gabby's adoption be successful, the adopter will inherit her original file as proof of the training she has gone through, including the contacts of the dog trainer. Q : Will Gabby defecate / soil our porch area? A : No. We have trained her to understand that she is to do her business only while outside of the home. The adopter(s) must commit to walking Gabby twice a day. Once in the morning and once in the evening, everyday. Q : How long should these dog walks be? A : Anything from 15mins and above should do the trick. As long as Gabby gets her walks, gets to do her business, she will be a happy dog. And a happy dog makes a happy master :) Q : Is Gabby spayed, dewormed and generally checked for good health? A : Yes. Her medical records are all with our trusted vet. You will also be given her medical book for proof and as a reference to her visits to the vet. Q : Why the fees? A : We have taken pains to ensure that Gabby's properly vaccinated, dewormed, anti-flea/ticks, fed healthily, socialised (used to human interactions) and above all, trained for Basic Obedience commands to allow the adopter to have a much more easier time with the new pet. Our fees includes : 1. A sleeping cot 2. her favourite toys 3. medical book 4. file & certificate (certified by a pro trainer) 5. Walking leash & collar Q : I / We have never had a pet dog before, how will I know if I am doing the right thing? A : Don't worry. We will spend time with you and Gabby to teach you how to maintain her good habits and training in order for the transition to go smoothly. This will usually take about 2 to 3 hours. Should you have any questions, you may contact us for further advise as well. We will be happy to help you feel at ease with your newly adopted pet until you are ready to be on your own with Gabby. Temperament Testing & The Suitable Adopter : As Gabby has undergone a professional Temperament Test by our trusted dog trainer, we are delighted to share with you on the sort of suitable owner(s) she will be comfortable with. 1. If you are a family, your children should be at the age of 12 or above, and will not be afraid of dogs. All family members should also be responsible, take turns for practising & maintaining Gabby's training to ensure her obedience. 2. If you are a single person, you should be one of a stable routine & with a commitment to taking care of Gabby for the rest of her life. In return, you will have the most loyal and affectionate companion for life. 3. Gabby has been tested as a gentle dog with a friendly disposition. She is not aggressive nor is she territorial. She will love any attention you can give her, but she is also capable of being on her own most of the times as long as her basic needs (daily walks, food, drinks, play, training) are met. 4. Gabby is good on her own as the only dog in the household. If you have another dog, and would like to adopt Gabby as a companion, it would be advisable if your dog is also given a temperament test to determine if your dog is compatible with Gabby. Gabby is Not Good with aggressive and dominant dogs. Also note, if you wish to have Gabby as a companion to your existing dog, all her training could be for naught if your dog is not trained to listen to commands. Preferential treatment will render all of Gabby's training useless. 5. If you have a cat, have no fear! Gabby is friendly and docile towards felines of all kinds. In fact, Gabby is a cat-magnet in our neighbourhood. To date, she has \"rescued\" two kittens (one adopted, one in foster care) and is not aggressive towards cats, she just wants to play with them mostly. 6. Gabby has received the first Basic Obedience Training. Should you wish to pursue the next course, she is ready for the second stage : Intermediate Training (with more detailed & varied disciplinary commands). Requirements for adoption : As we have faced many set backs in regards to the adoption of our rescued pets, we would like for any potential adopters to meet these basic criterias before contacting us : 1. As an adopter, you should have your own landed property (not rental - neither owned by the company you work for nor renting under another name). This is to avoid any future problems such as re-homing the pet. 2. As an adopter, you should have a stable & existing job to provide for the adopted pet's every need. 3. Adopted pets should never ever be abandoned again if you feel incapable in providing for them. 4. As an adopter, you must realise that when you take on a pet, they will be an addition to your life in every aspect of every way. Adopting a pet is akin to adopting another family member. Love is not enough as all manner of care, responsibility & commitment to their happiness will be in your hands. If you have any doubts, please carefully reconsider all these points mentioned above, so that we may spare the pet (and us) of any unnecessary stress. We love all of our rescues and treat them like our own kids, but we also discipline them without favour. We'd like you to think of them as your own kids too.\n",

Always seeking for attention & affection. Maybe because she lacks love..so a lot of love is needed for this baby! Serious adopters needed urgently! Adoption is free. Please contact me if you're interested. I can send her to wherever you are staying. For more pictures of the kitten, go to: Thanks everyone!\n",

      "Meet Baby Rosemary, one of the puppies that we intend to rescue out from the area where they hv been seeking shelter since born - longkang near the surau. We recently found out that the timid mummy that we have been feeding actually gave birth to 7 puppies, but roughly 2 weeks ago, one heartless human being took one stick & jolok the hole near longkang where the puppies have been seeking refuge. And with that 3 was killed. Such a sad thing isnt that such hatred still exist? Why have to kill these innocent puppies? Moving on, we hope to get the 2 remaining puppies soon. They are kinda protective & barks loudly when touch. Who doesnt if they are subject to constant harassment & abuse like the dead siblings, rite?\n",
      "This kitten which I named him Brave,was lying lifeless under the dark staircase of my condo. I guess Brave was not meant to end his life there, he managed to meow softly which somehow caught my attention. I quickly picked him up and was shocked to see that Brave was so skinny and could barely walk. Brave's body was so cold and his eyes were half opened. Without any hesitation, I used a thick towel to wrap him up and tried to hand feed him with some wetfood,he refused to eat, fed him with some milk and water, he refused to drink, Brave was simply too weak to eat and drink. Brave was infected by a virus similar to that of parvo virus in a dog. That night, Brave was just lying and closed his eyes with heavy breath and i thought that he might not be able to make it to the next day. However, in the middle of the night, i heard a soft meow, it was Brave ! he was meowing to me ! he managed to raise up his little head eventhough he still could not stand up and walk. Immediately, i fed him some milk and water and he drank ! i monitored Brave's condition throughout the night (he was having severe diarrhea as well) and rushed him to the vet, Dr. Tan (2nd chance panel vet) the next morning. Dr. Tan said by looking at Brave's terrible condition and based on her experience, normally kitten infected with this kind of virus and with such a low body temperature as well as severe diarrhea, Brave had a very low chance to pull through. Brave was hospitalised and continue to be monitored and i, already prepared to receive call from the Dr. Tan anytime about the bad news on Brave, However, Brave has such a strong will to live, he began to perk up the next day, he can stand up and walk, he started to eat and drink by himself ! Yesterday, i dropped by at the clinic and Dr. Tan said that Brave's temperature has gone back to normal despite a bit of a diarrhoea. Brave not only ate and drank on his own, he even walked out from the cage and greeted me with a loud meow ! After a while, he started to groom himself ! What a joy! So, this is a wonderful and happy story about Brave and i hope that someone can foster Brave or better still, adopt him ! because Brave definitely deserves to be loved, doesn't he ? I hope that someone is kind enough to foster him. if he is not adopted, at least he is under the good hands of the fosterer and until the time that he is totally recovered and strong enough, i have to put Brave back to his colony. i hope Brave is fit and strong enough to be a community cat at my condo. Brave is really a miracle to me, he really wants to survive and he does ! Try to look at the pictures that i attached, his eyes are full of fighting spirit.......... Interested parties and strictly for cat lovers only, pls call Mei Leng at\n",

      "What a happy gorgeous dog Captain Kip is! He weighs around 10kgs and full of jest. Wait ! He is fearless and would go for bigger dogs. His mum is a Miniature Pincher you see. Regardless the fact that he's been thrown into a pound and had to endure hard and harsh times he just bounced back from it all with such a happy playful heart! This a testament to his will and character. Top dog i would say. Come and see him. \"This dog is one of the dogs rescued from the Klang Pound in April just before D-day (when they are put to death). It has been rehabilitated and urgently needs a loving home as we have limited resources. It is unfortunate that due to the aggressiveness of the contracted dogcatchers, most of these beautiful dogs are not strays and previously had homes. Hence, most of them are sociable and loving.

      "Nottie & Choomi are both rescues. Nottie was a dorm kitty in Nottingham University. I adopted her when she was 5 mths old. She wandered into the campus and stayed with the students for a while, a learned kitty and a graduate I would like to say. So, she can be a bit of a snob sometimes. But she loves pats and scratches and paper balls. Her meow will melt even the hardest heart. She would be almost 3 years old. I call her my Zen kitty. Always calm, cool and collected. Choomi was rescued when she was a tiny 3 weeks old and sickly. Slept on my chest for weeks. But she's a survivor. She's now almost 2, healthy, active, loving, cheeky and chatty. I always talk to her and she'll answer back. They are both house cats, loves basking in the sun on the balcony or windows and much loved. Both are spayed, chipped and vaccinated. They have had their rabies and leukaemia shots as well. I have to put them up for adoption due to unforeseen circumstances and it's a decision which is causing me and my son great pain. I am looking for kind and compassionate cat lovers who is willing to welcome both my girls into their family and loving homes. Please. There must be kind souls out there.\n",

As if she cannot trust humans anymore... :-( she had a mental breakdown and bit my friend two other German Shepards. She has gotten better and she knows how to control her moods. But do be aware that this poor girl has been through ALOT of stuff. So she has just gotten used to trusting humans again. please, please do try and think about this!! She is in need of a home very badly and she needs a SPECIAL loving home that can care for her for the rest of her life. I know she may not be a chubby little puppy, but face it puppies are going to be harder to train and mongrel dogs are very very hardy. Considering that when the doggy bit the two German Shepards, it only took her 1month to recover fully.And the German Shepards 5 months to recover. If you have a safe loving home, and if you have the paitience and the heart to commite to this. Please do email me. (photo's will come soon)\n",

We brought her to vet, and was informed she has atopic dermatitis which might be the reason she was abandoned by her previous owner. We then had her cleaned and shaved in pet shop to prevent lice/ fleas/ fungus as she has been strayed for some times. Almost 2 weeks into our fostering, we found no trace of lice/ fleas on her, her skin condition also seems to be improving. A nice and loving dog she is. Self content with toys and occasional walk. But due to our hectic life we are unable to provide her a forever home. Looking forward for her a loving family that will cherish and treasure her.\n",

      "Picked up a mother cat with 2 kittens to send for spaying. Mother cat just being spayed by us on July 30th, and put back on the street. Her 2 kittens are available for adoption too, and their photos are shown below. Rescuer Note: Kittens are not ready to be neutered yet until they are 6 months old. It is very important to neuter them when they are ready, as this will prevent them from getting lost. The male cat will wander off your home to find any female cat on heat, while the female cat will wander off when on heat, and will get pregnant. Risk of losing your cat is very high if you don't neuter them. And also your cat may risk injury due to fighting or your furniture will risk damage as well, as un-neutered cats are more aggressive.\n",

My new foster took me home, my eyes hardly see anything and almost blind because of the tick fever. I went to doctor, and my eyes is getting better now. My new fosterer gave me heart guard and apply front line on me. I am always horny that's why I can't get along with my new foster female dog.

I wish I can find someone who willing to give me a good home, I don't like been tied up or staying in cage any more, I need patient people to train me, I am willing to learn. I want to be spay because I hate breeder to use me as a money making machine. Please bring me home, I can bring a lot of joys to you and your family. Please contact my foster and take a look at me.

      "If contacting by phone, SMS/WHATSAPP only please. \"Hey there! A nice lady found me in Nilam Terraces in Puchong sometime in end April. She asked the neighbourhood guards about me but no one knew who I belonged to and the guards said I'd been wandering around for 2 weeks. The nice lady posted flyers around the area and asked all the Puchong vets about me but after 3 weeks no one has claimed me. So my carer who has a fondness for anime decided to call me Chibi (\"small\" in Japanese) and help me look for a new home. I may be small in stature (only 6kgs!) but will readily bark to alert you to someone at the door! I love to be snuggled - belly rubs are the best! I'm good with other dogs and like playing with small to medium dogs. I have sensitive skin so I hope my human will feed me a good quality diet. I do my potty on the grass or near drainhole covers - my carer thinks I was previously an indoor dog and perhaps potty trained to wee in the bathroom :) Since my past is unknown, I haven't been sent for neutering but please do the responsible thing and spay me after I go on heat if that happens. I'd really like to spend many happy days cuddling on the couch with someone who will tickle my ears and kiss my little apple head - are you the one for me?\" Conditions for adoption: 1. No unnecessary tying/caging up. 2. Maintain medical needs (vaccinations, deworming, flea/tick/heartworm prevention etc.) 3. Adoption fee of RM to partially cover vaccination, deworming, heartworm test/prevention, tick + flea prevention and skin treatment. 4. If she is found to be intact (i.e. goes on heat), spay after her heat cycle ends. 5. Allow visits in the initial stages of adoption to ensure dog is adjusting well - for this reason adopters residing in Klang Valley are strongly preferred. 6. Unconditional love :) To help determine if you and the dog you're interested in are a good fit, would appreciate it if you could email with: - A brief intro of yourself - Your experience with dogs if any - Your household situation (what type of home you live in i.e. landed or apartment, whether you have other family members/friends living with you etc.) - Any other pertinent info that will help match you with the right pooch :)\n",

      "A stray female had nested in my garden and gave birth to a litter of 3 kittens. I discovered them pretty much the day they were born and have been taking care of all of them indoors. All three kittens are male with distinct personalities developing. They have lovely markings on their coat. They haven't been weaned yet but will be ready for adoption by the 15th of July. I am slowly transitioning them to solid food and mummy cat and I are litter training them. Mummy cat is very affectionate and will love to sit by you and be scratched. She will make a really lovely companion for someone. She has settled in quite comfortably so I foresee she will adapt quite easily. She is quite a young mother, no more than 2 years old. She also seems friendly towards other cats (my two cats are not the friendly type hence she needs to be adopted). My request would be for potential adopters to neuter/spay the kittens (once of suitable age) and mummy cat so that we don't end up with more strays on our streets.

      "a nest of small puppies from about 5/6 weeks. They are still on mothersmilk, but will be ready for adoption in a few weeks. If you are intereted, come and have a look. The canine socialization period takes place between week 6 and 8, and is one of the most important stages of development of the dog. What they learn from their dam and littermates during this period greatly influences the rest of their lives. During this stage the puppies learn bite inhibition and canine socialization skills that are critical skills for a dog, and dogs that miss this stage often have behavioral problems which land them in shelters later in life. They may have serious problems getting along with other dogs, and can have problems with biting, because they never learn to adjust the pressure of their bite, and that teeth hurt.\n",

She is a very calm & relaxed cat. Occasionally being naughty & playful. Enjoys head & chin rubs. A bit timid, but can get very manja once she gets acquainted with people. Very suitable for senior adopters or families who appreciate peace & quiet environment. Potential adopters will be screened to ensure Kumina will be in good hands. Prefers adopters who has experience dealing with cats & understands the full responsibility of having one. The adopter should be patient enough to deal with Kumina as she might have some trust issues with strangers. The adopter should also be able to commit to bring her to the vet & feed her medicine when necessary & supplements continuously as Kumina has slight health issue in the past.\n",

      "We raised her since she was a healthy little puppy, therefore she grew up to be a very healthy and loving young dog. She has already been spayed, dewormed and vaccinated so that's something not to worry about. Although she is very friendly, it might take her a while to get used to new people - but I guarantee once she gets to know you, she'll be the most loyal dog you can imagine. Everytime I'm on my way back home, she somehow hears the sound of the car from meters away and knows I'm back and readily waits at the gate - every single time. I would never let go of her but since I'm gonna have to leave Malaysia, I have no choice. Hence, if you are someone who will take good care of her, love her and give her some attention once in a while, she'll be yours.\n",

      "Brim (short for Brimstone) was rescued by me three months ago. I found him near death and with severe, chronic mange, ticks, ulcerated wounds, an ear abscess and severely malnourished. After a few weeks of patient, loving kindness and veterinary attention he is now a very healthy, lively dog with a gentle nature. Brim is a special dog with an unusually gentle nature. It appears Brim may have been abused before being thrown into the street. He is shy around strangers and becomes nervous with loud noises. He would NOT be suitable as a guard dog. His temperament is too soft but he will make a great family pet and so I'm looking for a genuinely loving person or family willing to give Brim a lot of love and freedom to run around. Ideally this would be in a quiet part of the country or in a home with a large garden. I have started training him. He's now house trained, sits and comes on command and will leave the room when told to do so. He is also leash trained and will walk to heel. As I am only visiting Malaysia I need to find Brim a suitable home as a matter of urgency. If interested please email or phone [no messages please].\n",

      "Tiggy was found at our condo carpark 3 days ago, lost and very thin. She has no discernible injuries or health problems, only malnourished. No ticks or fleas. Today, after a few rounds of Whiskas kitten food, a bath and a clean environment, she is bright-eyed and stronger; plays like any normal kitten. She is unafraid of people and loves nothing more than to be with people. She is now toilet-trained on a sandbox. She also does not meow very much, behaves like an intelligent kitten instead of an annoying howler, loves to be petted, purrs an awful lot. Nobody has come forward to claim her, and efforts to find a home for her on FB is still fruitless. Tiggy will be an easy cat to care for, as she is independent yet loving, toilet trained and quite neat. She needs some love and attention, responsible owners who will neuter her and give her the security and care she deserves. I will only be in Malaysia for a few weeks, so am now URGENTLY looking - and hoping - for a home for Tiggy. She deserves better than to be a street cat, left to die or get run over.

      "9 October : Blackie Boy went to a very loving family and a home with space for him to roam! ***** Blackie Boy is an adorable dog who loves following people around (those whom he trust, especially his fosterers!!!) He enjoys lazing on grass, and trotting around (being chased by his human companions for exercise). Blackie Boy responds well to his name, and will look up everytime he's called, and knows the command come. He enjoys food, especially pure chunks of chicken breast, high 5 bread with butter (though the vet's advised not to give him butter as it's bad for dog's pancrease), and his kibbles! He loves crunching on kibbles, and doggie-snacks! Blackie Boy is available to a good home with loving family members who'd spend some time with him and ensure he gets to roam free in the garden. He's ideal for families and especially those who love dogs! Note: he's a penchant to escape from homes where he doesn't feel loved, whereas at his fosterers..even when he strays out, he'd hang around just outside the home, knowing there's love and security there. So, those of you with BIG HEARTS, adopt him!!! Great for older folks, families or singles with lots of love! He's easy to maintain!\n",

      "6 Jan :30: We found this poor dog (male) wandering around the few blocks of shophouses doing wholesale clothing opposite Kenanga Wholesale City (Ho Ching Yuen). He wears a very dirty blue collar, with no I.D tag. According to those shop owners and some workers there, he has been wandering around the area for the past 2 days. Looked very hungry so we tried feeding him some corn that i had bought, but he was very timid, he will not approach the food if we put the it on our palm, so we leave it on the floor and move away, and he ate them. When people go near him, he will run away too. There are many cars in that area, he can get knock down very easily. We managed to get him and send him to a dog shelter in Cheras. He is not aggressive at all, looks timid and insecure and did not make any noise (no barking). Unfortunately this dog shelter in Cheras is also very full, i begged them and they agree to temporary shelter him when I go look for fosterer or adopter. This poor boy looks very unkept right now, but I believe he will looks better after grooming. I know many will not give this boy a second look, but I beg you to please give this boy a chance to be loved. Please adopt over buying.\n",

      "Hello there...my name is Meadow! ♥ I'm a female puppy, just turned 5 months old last week. ♥ I have a very special fawn/cream coat and big-jumbo ears. I'm the CUTEST thing whenever I wag my short/kinked tail! ♥ If you're a person with an active lifestyle, then I'll make a perfect sidekick! I have a deep love for speed running in fields and I'm pretty good already at coming \"back\" when called. ♥ Please don't underestimate my playful energy though...I'm a VERY gentle and sweet girl around every person I meet (especially children). ♥ I love mingling with other dogs, puppies and cats too! Foster mummy has socialized me to my best potential. ♥ I know how to go potty in one specific corner of the porch (if you can't take me for walks). I'm a fast learner mind you, it won't take me long to adapt to new tricks, disciplines or your lifestyle! :) ♥ Foster mummy has had me de-wormed and sprayed with Frontline (for flea prevention). I'm not a fussy eater at all, kibbles or canned food, I'm absolutely fine with anything. :) PLEASE READ (Note for potential owners): • Meadow should not be caged or leashed (unless it's for temporary needs). She's a freedom loving puppy. Please drop me a call or email if you feel that you may be just the right person to give this girl a home. Thank you!\n",

      "Hugo is an active and robust English bulldog that needs love and attention from the owner. Unfortunately for us, we are unable to provide him the attention that he deserves as we have full time jobs as well as 2 other dogs, a bird and 3 guinea pigs at home to care for! He is a pure pedigree English bulldog, has not been neutered and has been given full vacination as a puppy. Before he is given to his new home, we will give him another round of booster vacination if adviced by the doctor. He stays outside the house in our home at Damansara Heights as he likes running around exercising and due to that, he is not toilet-trained. He is however quite intelligent for a bulldog as he knows how to play throw and fetch and runs away when he knows he is going to get a scolding :) We love him tremendously, but unfortunately, we are not able to keep him. We hope we will be able to find a nice family for him (we would prefer if the family has no other dogs since Hugo can get over-friendly without knowing his size and strength. He also tends to get jealous easily). If there are anybody out there interested in adopting Hugo, please give me a call. We will also interview prospective adopters to see if Hugo is a suitable dog for them. If the need arises, we will also do house visits to see if the house will be a conducive for an active bulldog like Hugo. Please note that we love our dog very much, and therefore, no breeders will be entertained. Preferably KL families only as we want to check future adoptive families' homes to ensure that it is right for our dear Hugo. Thanks :)\n",

      "Shiro is a white lilac-pointed kitty who looks a bit like Taylor Swift. She is timid but gentle and very intelligent. She thinks the best place in the world is to be near her human at all times. She will insist on joining you when you watch TV, use the computer, cook, use the toilet, shower and will even try to help you choose the clothes to wear. She looks like a Siamese cat, but she is a local street-born, complete with a double-kink tail. Also like a Siamese cat, she has a wide vocabulary of sounds from cute raspy squeaks to out-loud cries. Her purr motor is loud and turns on very easily. Shiro has a silky soft coat and greatly enjoys playing with her toys and getting her fur brushed. 11 March . Rescued from the streets and was covered with filth, car grease and was mostly skin and bones. 12 March . Shiro was taken to the vet where she was de-wormed and de-fleaed and given antibiotics. She weighed g on that day and pronounced to be a girl and 2 and half months old. 30 March . Shiro was given her first vaccination and was de-wormed again. Her weight has shot up to 1.25kg. The vet thought that she is closer to 3 and half months old at this point. 29 Apr . Done with the second jab and she weighed 1.75kg. 27 May . Done with the third and final vaccination jab. Her weight at this point is 2.15kg. 3 June . Spayed. The adopter shall receive her vaccination card and medical records from the vet. Current diet: * Dr. Gary's Best Breed kibbles. Taste of the Wild cat kibbles. * 2 meals per day of fresh raw chicken/beef pieces mixed with either one of these canned food – Fancy Feast, Monge and Fussie Cat. Or mixed with bonito/sardine flakes (the type sold in Japanese food section) * Favourite treat – washed and blanched ikan bilis mixed with raw chicken. * Also eats raw chicken neck chopped to small kitty bite sizes. Given no more than once a week as it can cause constipation. * She enjoys Farm Fresh plain yoghurt. * As treats, she likes Greenies Roasted Chicken Dental Cat and Greenies Smartbites Skin & Fur Salmon. Cat litter – Shiro currently uses Cat's Best by ÖkoPlus. She loves clean litter boxes and is obsessed with how the flushing toilet works. Suitable adopter – a person who can: * Give Shiro safe indoor environment. * Offer a \"safe room\" to slowly introduce Shiro to her new home. The room must be big enough to put in her litter box, a pet carrier with her toys and bowls of food and water. This is important to ensure she does not freak out when she sees so many new things and people. The room could be a spare toilet or a large pet cage or even the bedroom so that she can sleep with you at night. * Ensure that Shiro is kept indoors always. * Put up with her crying and hiding during the intro period. Shiro is a shy timid cat and she will hide and probably cry for the first few days in her new home. Please be understanding and spend as much time as possible with her to gain her trust and love. * Give Shiro a companion. Shiro hates to be alone. The companion could be a younger cat or a human. *Provide her with nutritous meals suitable for a cat. NOT suitable adopter – a home that: * Leaves Shiro many hours alone. * Has an \"open door” policy – Shiro cannot survive outdoors. To be outdoors, a cat has to have some tough badass attitude, and Shiro has none of it. She is just a complete sweetheart who wants manja and sayang. Please email or text me why you want to adopt Shiro and introduce who you are.\n",

      "Adopter/fosterer diperlukan untuk 2 ekor kitten dan mama mereke sekali. Mama cat is a stray cat yang selalu datang ke rumah saya untuk meminta makanan. Baru-baru ni she gave birth to 2 kittens kat rumah jiran saya yang tak suka kat kucing. I managed to pujuk him not to throw away the kittens as they're still small (he's not a cat lover). Semalam, saya find out yang the mama cat bawak anak2 dia berpundah randah pergi ke rumah jiran saya yang lain pulak, this time under a shoe cabinet. Now this neighbour of mine really hates cats. He's gone balik kampung until this Friday, just before he left he told me that if the kittens & mama cat are still there when he comes back then he will throw them away at the nearby pasar :( The mama cat is about a year old I think, and the kittens are about 1 month old, so they're still menyusu so if possible have to adopt them with the mama cat sekali. If not, saya prefer kalau adopt kedua2 kitten tu sekali kerana mereka sangat rapat. You can have a look at all of their photos here: There's a video here too: Adoption is free, saya boleh hantar mereka ke mana2 sahaja lokasi di sekitar KL & Lembah Klang.\n",

She can jump really high. She knows how to walk on a leash. She knows how to poo-poo outside while walking. She has had all her shots and she is neutered. She broke her back leg and she has a metal piece and screws but she has fully recovered. She can be weary of people and growl until she smells them. She doesn't bite but she can look scary when she looks at people a certain way. *********************** The black one is Carlos. He can sit and give both paws. He can sit with both paws up in a begging position. He knows how to walk on a leash. He knows how to poo-poo outside while walking. He has had all his shots and he is neutered. He is a fearful dog and is afraid of his own shadow. He barks loudly but he is never aggressive. Carlos cannot live without Bella- if she is out of his sight, he cries and moans in pain.\n",

      "Dear God, I have been sitting here for weeks now. Everyday I look out hoping someone will come take me home...But sadly, no one came so I continue to pray...and pray...and pray...to you every night before I sleep, hoping my prayers will soon be answered... I heard the humans whisper among themselves the other day that someone is interested in me...My ears immediately perked up. Finally, I thought! I clean myself up, make myself pretty and waited eagerly for the \"one\" to show up. 30 minutes, 1 hour, 3 hours passed...and soon the sun starts to set but still no one turn up. With a heavy heart, I accepted the truth. Silently, I said my prayers for the day... Oh, Mighty God...Please give me a chance. I am not greedy...I only need food, shelter and a lil' TLC. In return, I can give back a lot more...fun...joy...happiness...loyalty. Please let my wish come true soon...I promise to be a good girl, staying true and loyal to my new companion... AMEN! From a lil'pup who is still waiting anxiously for her 4eva home....♥♡♥♡\n",
      "I rescued this poor puppy from the streets. This poor gal was almost hit by a passing car. I has taken the puppy to a to a vet. However, i was unable to foster/adopt the puppy as i already has 2 dogs at home. The puppy is currently being boarded at a pet shop. The pet shop will be closed during Chinese New Year holidays. There will be no one to take care of the puppy. If you can help to foster the puppy until an adopter can be found please contact me. It would be best if someone can give this beautiful little gal a forever home so that she can have a warm place to stay not only this CNY but for the rest of her life.\n",

      "READ BEFORE DECIDING! Mio is an active, playful, and talkative male cat. He used to be my friend's pet, but later given to me because my friend moved oversea. He already stayed with me for about 5 months until now. He really is a smart and beautiful cat, but since I'm just a university student I cannot afford the fee for his vaccination and neuter. He is now in heat state and need to be neutered soon or mate with female cat, but I don't dare to mate him with stray cat. So that is why I choose to give him for adoption for free, as a hope that someone might adopt him to take him to the vet or just mate him with female cat that you might have. Plus I will also give along his cage, food bowl, and litter box, all for free. Here I tell you some about Mio personality so you can take into consideration before adopt him. - Very talkative, so you have to be ready to hear some noises from him - He is on heat, so he will be more more noisy during night sometimes - Spoiled cat, so make sure you give him lot of affection - Toilet trained, he really can pee in your toilet bowl if you allow him to - Super clean, he doesn't like dirty cat litter - Stubborn, he can become very stubborn when it comes to bed, which he might insist to sleep with you on your bed or jump to your lap and he will become noisy if you don't let him to do so. - Afraid of thunder and heavy rain, yes if there is a thunder storm or heavy rain he will definitely meowing very loud to get your attention, he will be quiet when he is accompanied. - Might become aggressive to new cat, I guess this is because he is on heat, so if you wished to mate him with your cat it may take longer time for them to adapt. - Do not confine the cat in the cage although I give you the cage, because it will make him stress. But overall, he is very nice, cute and unique isn't he? He also love to cuddle :) Contact me by email or whatsapp if you are ready to adopt him and accept the consequences above. I really hope that you will become a nice new owner, and please BE A COMMITTED AND RESPONSIBLE OWNER for Mio. Thank you ;)\n",

      "I need urgent help finding home for this mommy cat and her kittens, just born last night. My condo doesn't allow pets and the guards will throw the kittens into dumpster if found out.

I really love this cat, so I hope to find someone who I can trust to look after her and her kittens. Updates: / - a neighbor willing to switch turns with me looking after the cat and the kittens, and willing to adopt the white kitten once it's big enough to be adopted. Therefore the mother cat is no longer up for adoption. Kittens will be given up for adoption after 3 months old. / - application has been sent to SCRATCH for spaying subsidy, and has been approved. 1/1/ - the three kittens has started opening eyes a bit. Yellow/green mucus comes out from the eyes, cleaned with baby oil. The mother cat also tried to move her kittens because someone had been disturbing her resting place. 3/1/ - mother cat has been bathed and cleaned. 16/1/ - a cardboard has been placed on the grill door to prevent kittens from running out. 18/1/ - while cleaning their bedding, I noticed the kittens have better and healthier eyes, so most likely I don't have to keep cleaning their eyes anymore. 20/1/ - kittens are now staying inside the shoe cabinet with shoe boxes outside as their playground, and a hanging ball of yarn. 24/1/ - kittens were given Frontline spray for ticks.\n",

      "Bubu (male) and Betty (female) were rescued when they were 1 mth old. Now they are healthy and very manja. I was reluctant to put them up for adoption as both are very manja with me. However, my neighbor has recently complained about them going over to his compound. I suspect he will do something untoward. I now have to cage both for long hours. Not exactly ideal for cats. I can't keep them indoors as there are already 5 cats living indoors, and they are quite unwelcoming of newcomers. Really need an adopter who stays around Seremban, familiar with cats and their requirements, and have secure front- or backyard. I am willing to sponsor their food for one year. Do call me at. Thanks.\n",

She loves cuddling with humans and is litter trained. We can't keep her so we are looking for a nice home for her. She would be an excellent companion for anyone (especially children and the elderly). If she can have surgery for her eyes we will happily sponsor the cost, she is too young to be neutered right now.\n",
      "Hi, I'm looking for a forever home for my two ginger boys, Nemo & Tigger. I have too many cats at home and after much consideration, I've decided to let both brothers go because they're the most affectionate among my many cats and they absolutely love being in the company of people. They're the sort of cats who would drop to the floor when they meet anyone and roll on their backs begging for tummy rubs. They're also very vocal and we've spent many nights and days having such great conversation. They're an absolute delight for companions! They're very attached to one another which is why they can ONLY be adopted together as I can't bear to have the brothers separated. If you have any further enquiries, please don't hesitate to drop me a message on WhatsApp :)\n",

      "♥ Male, 8 weeks old, white cream point with blue eyes. Father was a Ragdoll and mother is an American Curl (given up by previous owners while pregnant). ♥ Christian is both a rambunctious player and a shy little love-dove! He is careful of new situations as much as he tests them, and once he warms up, he can skip over at his humans better than the fastest bunny. He's our favourite boy and it took a lot of heart to place him for adoption - heavy purrer (he'll sound like an engine!) and especially loves being stroked and kissed while carried. He can be a lap-cat when relaxing (not while he's busy playing of course, he'll jump off). Also enjoys being shown around the house. ♥ He's already had his first vaccination and deworming. Not fussy about kibble or wet food and is very clever with the litter box! ***IMPORTANT: Note For Potential Adopters*** - Christian must be kept INDOORS at all times. Apartments must be cat-safe. - He's been raised since birth on a grain-free healthy diet and this must be maintained (no Whiskas, Friskies, etc). Feel free to inquire if unsure, this is for any cat's long term well being. - Neutering is COMPULSORY and we will reject anyone who doesn't fit this requirement. There are far too many homeless kittens on the streets. If you feel that you may be just the right person for this boy, please drop me a message with details about yourself and your experience with cats (via WhatsApp or email). Thank you!\n",

      "Due to moving to a new residential that doesn't allow pets, we're unable to keep May as a part of our family. We will truly miss her and hope that someone can give her a new loving home. May is friendly and loving, but also a very good guard dog. She doesn't bite or is destructive to things - even our shoes and slippers were completely untouched! May is pretty obedient, when we need her to head into her cage she does it obediently on command. We used to give her car rides often too, so she loves it and doesn't panic while in it. Another lovable trait is that she almost behaves like a cat! She loves to keep her body close on an owner's leg, often sitting down or taking naps next to the closest human being. We hope someone will give her a home as we don't want to send her to adoption shelters. :(\n",

      "Our rescued dog gave birth to six beautiful puppies in late October (), and though she refused to care for them, we fell in love with them immediately. They've all been very well cared for - we give them all the proper nutrition, exercise and plenty of attention. They come from good stock - dad is a lab/mix, and mother is a mongrel (rescued when she was a few weeks old). The mother is a very good guard dog, so we're hoping her pups will have inherited her instincts. We've given two puppies away, and so four remain. We can't keep them all, so we're looking for easy-going and kind homes for these little bundles of joy. We've got three males and a female - all very well behaved (well, about as well behaved as puppies can be!). One is off-white, the three others are varying shades of golden brown (see pics). Please let us know if you or anyone you know may be interested.\n",

The mother hate cats, so she asked her to get rid of the kitten. In no choice, she left the kitty in a box with water and some ikan billis. I cannot let the kitten be so poor thing, so I decided to rescue the kitten. In that afternoon, I went to look for the kitty. I called \"Meow, meow!\". She responded and I found that she was in the rubbish heap. How stinky. I took her to a kinf hearted lady who owns a pet shop. She never sells dogs and cats, she adopted mongrels and keep cats at the back of her shop. Her husband was a pet trainer and groomer, so he bath the kitty. My muum didn't allow me to keep cats, because my dogs will eat the cats. Shadow is now in the kind lady's pet shop. You can call me for the address of that pet shop.

Slowly, I've noticed I wasnt the only “chosen one” as she would literally do that to every passerby. 😒 Ms. Faithful is a little bit timid, but that doesn't change her love and friendliness towards people. Being that, she has developed good reputation among the neigborhood. Everyone loves her. HOWEVER, recently the other stray animals have troubled the neighborhood, leaving them no choice but to ask for the services from MPK. How can we leave such kind dog to be caught and put to sleep?! So please, help me spread the words, Ms. Faithful is eagerly looking for some good samaritan to be taken care of. Someone that she can express and share her love for a lifetime.

      "Snow white was found on top of my washing machine just after I got my one cat to a new home. She was sleeping and was pretty weak as she got injured at her ear. I don't know how did she reach up there but my maid found her there. She was very scared of people and also fearful of the surrounding. We brought her to the vet and the vet told us her that she probably was caught up in some cat fight and some adult cat has torn her top ear away. She was given medication after that. She is pretty sweet but becomes protective of her food. Socializes well with other cats and I believe over time, she will become confident enough. The Rm is a temporary deposit and I will only return Rm back once you have proven me the spaying receipt for Snow White. Rm 50 is for adoption fees as I use it to help other strays also. If you would like, any amount of donation is appreciated. SPAYING is NECESSARY if you want to adopt Snow White. I will give you the contact of my vet and I will arrange the appointment if necessary. Adoption condition: 1) Tell me your experience on handling cat. 2) Love her unconditionally .3) If cannot take care of it anymore due to some reason, please return it back. But no such reason eg: She is already old. Hard to care for it. 4)Give updates whenever you have time.Anyone who is interested please do PM or email me a msg. After adopting Snow White, its up to you whether you want the starter pack or not.\n",

My mum had sent h for grooming (was very dirty and badly groomed). We cannot locate the poodle's owner. We had searched around my aunt's house area but no one lost a dog. Now we are looking for new owner for him. We cannot take care of him for long as we have our own dogs and cannot take care so many dogs. We are not sure how old is this poodle, but according to his size, maybe 6months-7months. He is a good dog, quiet but quite playful too. He gets along quite well with my dog. But he is quite shy/scared when someone especially strangers go near him, so we suspect the previous owner did not take good care of him. But he wants people to care for him ,always follows us around. So if you have good patient and can give him love, care and lots of attention, please adopt him. I think he deserve better place to stay. My mum is feeding him Bark Basic Plus at the moment. We are asking for adoption fees of Rm to cover his dog food (will give the adopter the dog food as well when come to pick him up) and grooming fees and also to ensure that the new adopter is seriously want to adopt him. If interested, please call my mum, Sasa. Only if you are serious. Having a dog s a lifelong commitment and responsiblity.\n",

She was found wandering around at Taman Tun Market calling for food. - Estimated to be around 2 months old. - Although she is a stray kitten, she is VERY human friendly. She isn't afraid to approach any human. I think maybe because she was surrounded by humans at the market. - She was really skinny, had flu and tiny eye infection, had lil fleas, dirty and has a skin issue. Her skin was dry and fur were shedding. She was really quiet the first 2 days, doesn't play but wants to be around human all the time so you can imagine how much she suffered on the streets. - She will be dewormed later on after the skin issue is cleared. (Improving well as she has been visiting the vet and is under medication) - She plays well, eats well, and her stool and urine looks good too! Familiar with litter sand. She has a playful biting habit nowadays though. She loves to bite my slipper and the boxes and my legs and my arms and the bottle and everything she can get her tiny paws on. I think it is cuz of her growing teeth. - She LOVES to play with paper clamp. - She likes to sleep with company. She's always beside me either on the bed or on the chair beside where I sleep. She also sleeps where I work or watches me do my work. - She has the sweetest meow just like the sweet kitten she is. She replies when you talk or look at her. - She is trained to come with a whistle tone. - I'm trying my best to get her in the best shape she can be before the adoption. - Please feel free to ask any further questions on the kitten. Thanks for your time to read through! ....I am in Bandar Utama. I prefer whatsapp but calls and messages are fine.\n",

      "Hello! My name is Mochi. I was rescued from a big drain in front of my rescuer's house two days ago. Don't ask me how I got stuck there, but I was so frightened, hungry and lost. I am safe now. My rescuer has put me on Avoderm and IAMS diet. She says I've got a good appetite. I have been Frontlined and dewormed too. I have just learned to use the litterbox, so give me a little bit more time and I'll be a pro at that (although my rescuer thinks I'm pretty good at it already)! My rescuer says that I'm very sweet. I've learned to warm up to humans and I love chin rubs and to be cuddled. I feel safe when I'm wrapped up in a blanket and held in someone's arms. I love to run after the cat teaser stick -- it's my favourite toy. I'm also quite good at playing the phone app for cats; it's cool...but nothing like giving the ol' feather stick a good chase! I promise I would make a wonderful kitty if I could grow up in a loving environment. The vet said I'm about 1.5 months old now and looking forward to a long and healthy life! Please contact my rescuer Aida at if you would like to adopt/foster me. Thank you! :) --------------------------------------------------------------------------------- (P/S: all potential adopters are required to fill in the adoption form and decision will be made after giving the answers/feedback careful consideration in favour of Mochi's current and future well-being.) ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n",

      "Hi, My name is GLEE and I’m full of glee. That’s because when I was 3 months old, I fell into a drain and couldn’t get out. I was wet, dirty, miserable and scared. Then a kind lady came and hauled me out of the drain by the scruff of my neck, took me home and cleaned me up. She took me to the vet where I had to have a jab and some medication. I was saved from sure death! Now I’m neutred, have all my 3 vaccination jabs, am healthy and quite cute & pretty. I’m now about 6 months old, but it seems I won’t be a very big dog. My Mummy says I keep growing long rather than tall & big. It’s okay, I don’t mind being a smallish dog. It makes it easy for me to move around the place. Because I’ve been so lucky to be saved, I’m full of glee and energy. You should see me run – I’m fast! I love playing with soft toys. I can sit, roll, paw & shake, and fetch – well, most of the time, I can. I love car rides & bicycle rides. I used to sit in the bicycle basket, but now I’m getting too big for it! And I’m not a big eater, so I’m pretty low maintenance. Sadly my Mummy can’t keep me as she already has 4 other furkids. I wish I could stay with her but I can’t. So I hope to have a loving home to go to – where I can bring life, joy and glee to my new family. I hope we meet soon!\n",

Must not cage or chain the dogs unecessarily for extended periods. 5. Must be fed good food and given water daily! (yes some people don't think this is important) 6.

Please note that there is no right or wrong answers as we just wish to learn more about the feline’s potential adopter before making the decision. Thank you. *Please don’t let this put you off as we did not have any prior experience with cats either.

I have been keeping him for 2 years, but was recently given a warning notice by the condo management that MBPJ has started taken action in removing pets in apartments after a year of my stay. We are forced to give her up for adoption. Being said, there are also another 2 cats, Molly (3yr, female, neutered mother of Zee) and nova (male, 4 months old). As for Zee, he is 2yr, male, spayed. I wish both Molly and Zee can be adopted together, due to their relation and the time spent together, they very much rely on one another. As for Nova, he is rescued on November , so he is still a new family member to Molly and Zee, nevertheless, they got along very well. All 3 of them are potty trained, they are also able to share food together. They have almost never shown any aggression towards each other. I wish the next adopter is knowledgeable about cat behavior, as it will definitely require some period of time for the cats to adapt to the new environment, financially independent, best if your are staying in a landed property. For confirmed adopter, I can still arrange for meet up even if its out of Klang Valley. THANKS!\n",

We weren't intending of getting another dog after the pain we went through seeing our beloved dog passed away.

It was a stressful three months during the treatment period since he was not to be excitable for fear of getting a stroke. It was difficult because he was an energetic dog who gets happy and excited whenever we are around. Thankfully, he survived and has since been living a healthy life.

      "Hello everybody! My name is Oreo, because I'm black and white, some people call me panda too! Just like my sister, I am adventurous and very loving (we got this trait from our mummy). We love people and being around people, and playing with people and snuggling up to people, anything people related! Will you be my furever friend? _______________________________ Back story, we feed a bunch of strays in our area and did not manage to get one of the female dogs to be spayed in time so out pop-ed 5 little angles. We are still struggling to get our older foster dogs adopted so we thought it would be okay to leave this family where they were. But the weather was very unkind and it rained during most of the night. As a result, this furry family ended up not having a warm place to sleep at night so we decided to take them in, give them whatever we can. Unfornutely, 2 of the puppies did not make it. RIP. However, we have 3 very strong and bright puppies up for adoption, Winnie, Oreo and Minnie! They were born on June 29th (which makes them a month old today!) The mummy, QT Pie is also up for adoption! For more info, please contact Kelly Tan (preferably whatsapp) Thank you and have a great day!\n",

      "The playground at the back of my parent’s place is a dumping ground for unwanted kittens. Normally; they are old enough to fend for themselves and they eventually leave the place. However, this lone kitten was around a month old or less when we saw him & was bawling away for 6 nights in a row, calling for his mother, finally on the 7th night, there was a thunderstorm & it bawled even louder, so we decided to bring the shivering kitten home to drier place. If anyone out there who is looking for an active & talkative kitten, this is the kitten for you. He is very attached to humans as he sits by the gate & watches us whole day long when he is not busy playing with dried leaves. Kindly contact Yee at if you are interested.\n",

      "The second puppy of Megan's first litter. Puma's the biggest pup out of the litter. He's healthy and he's a quiet type, un-neutered, 1 month old, and his coat is similar to a dark chocolate bar till he was about 3 weeks of age. Now it's greyish black! whenever he hears a foreign noise he does growl and puppy bark. Could be a good watch dog and companion! :) Just shower Puma with love and comfort, he'll definitely give back more. PUMA'S BIRTHDAY IS ON THE 21ST DECEMBER ! P/s : I recommend spaying/neutering Puma after the age of 2 years to avoid any health/growth abnormalities, which explains the pet being un-neutered. Conditions for adopting Puma: *Adopter must be attentive *RESPONSIBLE. Adopter should be willing to bare the expenses of future health probs (not just give up one day and leave/abandon the dog elsewhere) *Adopter must be caring, loving & thoughtful of their pet/pets *Like all dogs, Puma needs exercise so daily walks or plays during the week would be strongly necessary *Adopter must groom Puma occasionally *Adopter must be willing to vaccinate,de-worm & neuter Puma accordingly. *Adopter should be active in FB for the adopter to post photo's or updates about Puma to see how Puma is doing. *I may visit Puma un-occasionally at the adopter's place from time to time. *Adopter should bare in mind that once they adopt a pet, their responsibilities are forever so think well. I do not want Puma to end up abandoned in some place because the adopter can't be responsible enough. Please take good care of Puma.\n",
      "This kitten was shivering near the lift at my apartment one day. Mommy cat was no where to be found. He followed me around while I was looking for mommy cat, then decided to follow me home. He has been dewormed and will be sent for vaccinations on the 19th of Oct. He is very affectionate and active, litter box-trained and learns fast. He has an adorable meow (more like \"eow!\") Most of the photos of him were taken while he was asleep, because he is hyperactive when he is awake! As no one is at home all day while I am at work, he is starved of attention, and is confined to a room in my tiny apartment. I leave him with many toys and play with him until I am exhausted every night, but he still looks like he is bursting with energy and sometimes tries to run away. Perhaps it is not enough for him :( I feel sorry for him, and hope that someone can give him a loving home which suits him, and all the attention he deserves!\n",

      "This puppy was found abandoned during a heavy storm in the forest between my apartment and my work on Friday 21st March and nobody has either come forward to claim him or his mother did not come back for him after several hours of waiting. He was found in a very bad state, soaking wet, shivering and not walking very well. He is extremely friendly with me but is very nervous with everything else around him but has calmed down a lot over the last few days. I'm not sure what breed he is or how old he is. If i had to guess at an age i'd say roughly 8 weeks after searching on the internet. I am only here in KL as an intern so am returning back to the UK in June, if it wasn't for this I would definitely be keeping him. He's a really lovely puppy and deserves a loving family. Please get in touch if you need any more information. Thank you.\n",

      "On the 2/1/, while i was parking my car for work i stumble a female mongrel dog together with 6 puppies lying on a deserted house opposite subang airport. The house has been demolished half way and all the brick and wire was left there. The female dog was very thin and her bone was visible, the puppies (aprox 2 -3 months old) looks healthy to me. I decided to feed them kibble daily. The mother dog was very cautious with me she will wait until i put the kibble on the ground and move away only then she will eat the kibble and she never came close to me. The next day when i was on my way to feed the dogs i saw 1 more puppies is playing together with the rest of the 6 puppies that makes a total of 7 puppies. And the puppy was injured on her left leg, most probably she hurt herself while playing under the bricks and wire. Today 6/1/ was very lucky for me, i was able to catch the injured puppy and bring it over to the vet. Dr Sam told me that the puppy may have fallen or accidently cut on a sharp object while playing. It was lucky the wound been treated earlier if the wound is left untreated maggot will appear. Dr Sam have dewormed and clean up the wound and bandage it and told me to bring the puppy over to the clinic on this coming friday 8/1/ for some minor operation. The minor operation is to remove some excessive flesh and to stich up the wound so that it will recover more faster. But the real good news is the puppy was tested negative for distemper and parvo virus. Overall the puppy was in great health. The puppy is whining and sometime a bit of howling as if to me it was calling for its mother and her sibling. Temporary i will be fostering this puppy until it recover and hopefully there is someone is willing to adopt her, As i'm staying in an apartment and i'm having my own dog with me, i'm worry my neighbour will start to complain. There are 6 more puppies plus the mother dog waiting for adoption.\n",

      "I just found one on the 13th floor meowing away and the other at the pavement of the road.I think they are the same batch as they look similar. Have to pick them up as earlier there were 4 kitties which I thought that it would be better for the mama cat to take care before I take but it was too late, 2 disappeared (propably died too), one was thrown down from a high floor and the other was tortured by a 10 yr old boy. He poked both its eyes and twisted its neck before throwing it down also. Poor little kitten must be hell for him.\n",

      "I found the three musketeers abandoned outside my house while they were still newborn, without their eyes open.. I have been hand raising them to the best of my abilities and ensure they get 4 times a day food and milk to keep them happy and contented. For a month, I was bottle feeding all three to make sure they were well fed and watered. Blackie boy is the boisterous one among the Three musketeers.. He is friskier than the girls and loves to argue with me when i remove my slippers from his clutches. The only pup so far to have learned to bark.He also loves to sleep in the weirdest places-like in between the sliding door and the grille. If it fits, I sleeps! Brownie girl is the one with brown patches.. She is a fatty and loves to steal extra food from the other two.. so she is really a small piglet. But she learns fast and now sits on command, and has learnt that the living room is off limits with a simple NO. The largest of the three, and playful.Not bad for a tiny fella. Betty was named after Ugly Betty because she was the runt of the litter when newborn..Gave her special attention , nursed her from the bottle and kept her in my arms most of the time out of fear she may not make it through. After all that, she is truly a Betty and has bloomed into an adorable brown pup. She is the only one who does not bite me, but bites the others. Always with a cute sad face, she is my favourite of the lot. She loves to snuggle and prefers sleeping on my feet.\n",

I call one of them Pepper; she is a small to mediumship dog, female, is all black with a strip of white on her chest, medium brown eyes and approx around 1-2 years old. Her pup I named Hazel; she's less than 6 months, all light caramel hazel brown with stunning green brown eyes. They are both very playful and loving and have already been spayed,vaccinated and deformed as I brought them to the vet immediately. They were also very obedient at the vets and even scratched at the door to go potty outside then came back in!! Please if anyone is able to give these two dogs a home they deserve please contact me ASAP as they are currently being housed in a not so great environment offered by the vet as there is no room for them at any of the rescue shelters. I would obviously take them both in to my home in Canada but am not able to do so as I already have a dog who is very aggressive to other dogs. Please save their lives and yes I would to keep the two of them together not only because they are mother and daughter but because all they have is each other and that's how they were when I found them.

      "Hi cute-looking human out there, We were left with all our siblings in hunger condition without our mother. Not sure who had took all of us away from our mother, and dump us at the backlane of a shop. We were very hungry and we were almost eaten alive by surrounding stray dogs. In the midst of dying of hunger, luckily an angel came. He is the shop owner there, and he decided we should live, found all of us a temporarily foster home to take care of us. My fosterer took care of all of us when we were 4 weeks old, from sick, tiny and boney kittens. We are now healthy, playful and active 12 weeks old kittens. We thanked our rescuer and fosterer, for they have given us a chance to live. Please adopt us, we need a permanent home, as my fosterer said we are now healthy, big enough to be cared for easily and ready to be loved. Please give us a permanent loving home, and we promised to return your love. Thank you very much for adopting me. Please call/whatsapp/sms or to adopt me. Our adoption rules are as follow: 1. Kitten must be kept indoors to avoid accidents. 2. Kitten must follow up with the vaccinations. 3. Kitten must be spayed when reaches 6 months old. Rescuer Note: Kitten is not ready to be neutered yet until he/she is 6 months old. It is very important to neuter him/her when he/she is ready, as this will prevent him/her from getting lost. The male cat will wander off your home to find any female cat on heat, while the female cat will wander off when on heat, and will get pregnant. Risk of losing your cat is very high if you don't neuter them. And also your cat may risk injury due to fighting or your furniture will risk damage as well, as un-neutered cat is more aggressive.\n",

He is not well at the moment though, because his stomach is really bloated even though he's been dewormed twice. I'll be keeping a close eye on him in the mean time. Please think long and hard before you decide to adopt. It is a long term commitment as cats can live up to 15 years and require your time and attention, not to mention the expenses you would need to fork out for food, litter, vaccination, spaying and other medical costs that might be required in the cat's later years. Cats are also individuals and would have different personalities.

I can't keep them for long as I have 5 dogs on my own. They are very lively and friendly, i have exposed them to big dogs so they are not afraid generally. So if you are looking for some love and future dogs to guard ure hse and fun times please consider Chelsea and/or DuDu\n",

He endured some hardships during his 1st month as neighbors did not welcome him and the rest of the litter well (as the mother like to move them around between neighbour's garden). On 25th August , I managed to rescued 3 kittens and send to adopter but \"Tyson\" was so well hidden I did not managed to get him until 28th August . I remember it was a rainy night and I found him crying for his mother by the side of a drain. Luckily I managed to capture him without any issue and send him to his new owner \"Sammie\"; a foreigner studying here. At that point of time, Sammie said he will be here for another couple of few years and when he decides to go back, he will find a new home for Tyson. But I did not expect to hear from Sammie so soon about him leaving Malaysia permanently by . I made a mistake by letting a foreigner adopt Tyson but I know that Sammie treats Tyson well. So now that you know Tyson a little more, would you be willing to adopt little Tyson? See his pictures below, sent by Sammie to me during the few months they stayed together. **Sammie will pay for spaying expenses before surrendering Tyson.\n",

      ".: I as the owner decided not to give up on Zorro, so he has been with me all these while..however, im in need of favor and am looking for a temporary fosterer ...tops 3 months or less..preferably someone with landed property and very gentle with Zorro as he is quite a scaredy cat..he is afraid of strangers and large dogs but he is very sweet once he knows you. preferably someone staying nearby seputeh, brickfields, midvalley , bangsar area as i would be dropping by to pick him up for grooming or replenish his food. Yes all his stuff will be provided: -his favourite kibbles -his favourite wet food -his favourite treats -his towel, shampoo, conditioner, brush -his vitamins Anything he needs i will provide and i usually send him for full grooming once in 2 months or once a month depending on the weather. Like now its blazing hot so i will send him for grooming before giving him to the fosterer. If there is anyone interested let me know and of course i would need to scan through the fosterer as Zorro means a lot to me. If you are planning to get a dog for a pet but not sure if you can handle well this is your chance to have a pooch at ur place temporary to see if dogs suitable for u.. Zorro is a sweet dainty little dog.. He can be quite shy with strangers but once he is used to u, he can be very hyper when he wants to play. Though he is 5 years old, he can still behave like an excited puppy. He loves jumping around and skipping..He loves to 'lepak' in a small space like under his cage or the washing machine or the couch. He is very alert when i call for him and he knows quite a number of commands like sit, down , stay , no , in etc but his signature trick is \"malu\" and that's when he'll cover his eyes with his paws.Since he is a smart fella, i believe there are still room for him to learn new things.. Whenever i take him for a walk i dont need a leash bcoz he wont stray far for me and it will always be him who wants to go back inside. He is only meant for serious adopter who is a genuine animal lover looking for a lifetime companion. I would appreciate much if I could send him to his new home if there is any kind-hearted soul out there willing to take him and make him part of your family.\n",

      "Arya is a rescue kitten. She was found, alone, under a car on the streets. She was severely dehydrated, constipated, malnourished and was fighting an infection at the time of the rescue. She was taken to the vet to be dewormed and to get the proper medication. Since then (3 months), Arya has recovered and has grown into a cute and playful kitten. Arya is really playful and enjoys the outdoors. She is a keen explorer, but she will always come back. Arya is also very fond of cuddling. She will sometimes curl up on your lap or even lay next to you and sleep. Arya is also quite intelligent, she finds her way back. She is also adorable because she will follow you around and will greet you at the door (when you come home). She is friendly with other humans and is good with kids (but sometimes she's a bit too playful and jumps around). Arya is really an adorable cat. She is still small and growing. Ever since rescuing her, she has grown so much and is stronger and better now. I would love to watch her grow and take care of her, but my circumstances don't allow me to do that. Arya deserves a proper home and an owner who will commit, love and care for her.\n",

      "Named Nemo and Dory, this adorable pair was rescued off the streets in the USJ 6 area in an S.O.S. situation, when my friend and Pawse for a Cause colleague, Stewart, found them alone in the cold, hungry, helpless, and soaked to the bone, no thanks to heavy thundershowers at the time. He immediately paid a desperate call to pet rescuer, animal rights activist, and Pawse for a Cause founder, Seema Subash, for urgent assistance. She along with a member from her team, rushed to the site and rescued the puppies. They were only about palm-size at the time. Three months later, the puppies are still being fostered by her. They've received the required medical attention and have even been vaccinated. Seema is unable to permanently adopted Nemo and Dory because she already has other dogs in her care, pets who need her undivided attention. The brown puppy is female, while the white one is male. If you're serious about adding to your family, we are looking to have them adopted as a pair. It is crucial that they aren't separated since they are reliant on each other for their personal well-being and socialisation needs. For those keen on giving these puppies a new and loving home and second chance at life, do feel free contact me at (Deb) for an appointment with their current fosterer, Seema, to meet Nemo and Dory. They're super cute, bubbly as ever, enjoy a great time, and you'll absolutely love them. A little bit of love goes a long way. Thank you!\n",

We waited for the owner and even tried looking for her owner, but no one claimed her, so as of now she's staying in our house. I've changed her dirty collar into a new one.

      "I found these poor kittens in Taipan, Subang. They were meowing very loud and I went to check out and saw them inside a small box under the pouring rain and they were half wet.Not sure which idiot dumped them there. At first I thought maybe they were dumped together with the mother and maybe the mother went to search for food so I left them there but move the box little bit. Later that nite I went back to see if the mother came back. There's no sign the mother was with them and if I think back the box is damn small doesn't seems to fit in the mother so I came to a conclusion they were not dumped with the mother so I took them. Im begging any kind hearted to adopt them. I really really dont have enough space to keep them as Im staying in small apartment and I already have few kittens to take care. Please please..as long as you can give a proper food n shelter they're all yours and its not necessary that u have to take all 5 of them. Can also adopt 1 or 2 would really help.\n",

      "On Wednesday I was visiting PAWS in Ara Damansara to look for a new kitten for my family, when a gentleman arrived with very young pup he found on the side of the road lost from its mother. I offered to take it in to PAWS. Not knowing PAWS was closed on Wednesdays we then took the pup to the VET who confirmed she is a girl, healthy looking and between 7 to 10 days. We have been looking after her since Wednesday afternoon. She has been feeding very well and her urine and motion looks very healthy. She is very happy with her little tail wags and wriggling around the box. However, we live in a condo and due to personal/business life we are unable to look after or raise a dog. However, we do not want her to be put down or sent to shelter where she will most likely not survive. The poor little girl needs someone to hand raise her and give her the love and care she needs. If the right home for her needs financial support for her injections/vet/spade I am happy to help. **Update - it's been 5 days since I posted this and she is a super happy dog... lots of tail wags, she is very healthy... However she does need someone to be able to raise her and love her...\n",
      "Jasper was first found wandering around my neighbourhood and having wounds here and there. He was terrified when I approached him. I have applied medicine and his wounds have recovered and brought him to the vet for vaccination, de-wormed and neuter. I have been feeding him daily and keeping in my house on and off. I couldn't afford to keep him any more as my dogs cant get along with him and started to bark every night when I put him in the house. Once he is not in the house, he will join other strays and often come back with injuries. The worst part now I will be relocating to KL and unable to bring him along as I will be staying in a condo. He is very obedient, loyal and protective towards his owner. He never pees or poos in my house or bite anything. If you are looking for a watch dog he is definitely what you are looking for.

Since they were two months old, I slept with them every day until now. They are very close to me. Even I cried during writing this information. :'( But I cannot keep them all because I already have 11 cats for now. Due to limited space, this 4 baby is open for adoption. These cute baby should be an INDOOR cat only (I never let any of my cat out before, so they have not been expose to outdoor). Very sad to let them go actually~ Currently they are on Royal Canin for kitten. Let me tell you a little story about them. Miu Ciu, the youngest. Very naughty but spoiled. Have a short tail. The color is rather unique, where there are white, orange and cream colors. Oh yes, he likes to \"meow\" a lot. Small Black, the third born kitten. Look elegant and magnificent, probably because of its color. He is black and his hair is rather soft. His chest are white and also white-legged like wearing a socks. His eyes are always round as in ready for \"attacking\" mode. Orengy, second born kitten. A little careless and playful. His eyes were squinting. Long tail, orange tabby and white. The face looks confused, but also love to play. Lastly, Teleng. The first born kitten, getting severe flu when he was two months old, caused him a fever reaching 42 degrees celsius and even seizures. Now he's fully healed, but his head slightly tilted due to the fever. That's why he looks pretty cute with his shortcomings. Just like his brother, Teleng is black and white-legged. Anyone interested can contact me for pre-booking. This will also provide you some time to do the preparation before this two cute kitten come to your lovely home.

Grace is currently very much a healthy active puppy, I'm trying to toilet trained it but she still likes to poo and pee on her bed but I guess being bedridden for such a long time before this it does take a while to get used to not doing it there and she is absolutely adorable! Please give her a home k? I have 2 dogs at home and frankly am very much occupied with work to be able to cope with another such as Grace.

      "Heydee was found wandering aimlessly on the street like a lonely, hungry and thirsty dog 2 weeks ago. Her wounded and rugged condition caught my attention- flea, lice and tick infested, with lots of bleeding & weeping wounds all over her body. Despite her painful condition, she was a very happy, cheerful, energetic, positive attitude doggy, the tail wagging all the time. So I brought her to the vet, dewormed, deflead, deticked, vaccinated, spayed. I even shaved all her hair to allow the wounds to heal and so the new beautiful hair could start to grow. She's a beautiful, strong, healthy happy puppy now. Heydee is a very smart alert dog, she learned how to \"sit\" on command in just a few minutes. She's very adorable, cheerful, happy-go-lucky, well-disciplined. I already have 4 big dogs, I can no longer afford to foster her. Please find a home for this adorable chap. She's now staying in a temporary shelter, after 2 weeks I would have no place for her, with no choice but to return her to the streets. Please help, find her a home. She's very friendly to everyone, a good companion & perhaps guard dog too. She's 15kg. If you love dogs and are looking for a companion dog, to walk with you, exercise with you, play with you, cheer you up, destress, turn your mood around - she's the one for you. Cuddle her long hair and destress while massaging her (she loves massages).\n",

      "She is Juno, she was found in a mall parking lot. She was drinking from oil filled water spots and begging for food from stalls. She was always alone. It was such a pity for a little kitty like her and the danger of being run over was always there. I thought proving clean water & food would suffice, but I just couldn't leave her there. After a couple of days, took her back home and got her to the vet. Got her examined, especially her eye. The vet advised it could be self trauma or an accident that might have gotten her left eye, otherwise there is no sign of contagious bacteria or virus. She has been vaccinated, dewormed for the 1st round and given immune tabs to boost her immune as well. For the left eye, she was given a special kind of oilment to aid healing and also a maintenance to avoid any infection. She has been with me for about a month now. The eye doesn't bother her at all. She is a brave little survivor. She is healthier and more active than ever. I have another adult cat at home, and they just love to play and play. Juno is a very adorable loving cat... she just falls on your feet whenever she sees you to show how much she misses you and loves you. She is just a loveable little angel.\n",

      "Introducing Aslan: Male kitten, 1 1/2 months old, has white/orange patched fur and striking green eyes (slightly blue around the ends). Aslan was discovered wandering alone and meowing for attention at a morning marketplace in Serdang. He was slightly thin and dehydrated then, but has improved tremendously since his rescue. This fella will make a particularly great companion for people seeking \"manja\" or \"sweet-lap\" cats. He has a mild attitude towards play (not hyper) and is friendly with other cats as well. Quite vocal too if left alone for too long without pampering :) Additional details: Aslan's current diet is Royal Canin Babycat 34. He is very independent and clever with the litter-box. Aslan has been de-flead and de-wormed (is currently too young to be vaccinated). Please drop me a call or e-mail if interested.

      "(Urgent) This boy lives in the garage of my condo. I regularly catch the strays living around to neuter and vaccinate them. I did so with that boy last week. He is neutered and got his first vaccine shot. I am keeping him at home the time for him to heal properly. He is born in that garage, from a mix-siamese mum. His siblings disappeared but he stayed along with his mum. He has a really gentle nature so the other cats are bullying him. It turns out that he is really shy but loves being pet. With dome time, he will definitely get used to a family home. He already learnt how to use the litter. I can’t keep him as I already adopted 3 strays from downstairs that I will bring with me when I will leave Malaysia. So I am trying to see if I can find him a good family. I will keep him until the 10th of April. If by then I haven’t found a family, I will release him where I caught him. I will only let him go to a family that is not caging cats. Knowing where he comes from, caging will only make him unhappy. No outdoors, at least at the beginning, would be recommended. I am not going to ask you to pay for the neutering and vaccine, as I am willing to do it for giving strays a better life. All I will ask you is to keep the vaccination process on every year and to provide him a healthy and happy life. A cat lives an average of 15years. Please consider that if you adopt him. I am not getting him out of the streets to have him get back there in a few years.\n",

      "Daisy was rescued together with her sister, Molly, when they were found frantically running in the middle of the night inside a housing area in USJ, Subang. Due to their friendly nature, I suspect they have been abandoned or lost. My vet and I assume they are siblings because they were running in a pack of 2 looking for her earlier rescued sister. I'm not sure what is her breed mix but she an adorable pup. Daisy is a lovely puppy. She is friendly, loves cuddles, gets along with other dogs and very obedient. She has been vaccinated, dewormed, deflead and yet to be spay as she is approximately 3months old according to our Vet. Looking for a kind soul to give Daisy a second chance at a home. You can’t change a dog’s past but you could rewrite her future. Serious adopters only. Kindly contact the number in this profile. Thank you and god bless. Adopt, don't shop.

      "Jolly is a spayed 5 year old female mixed breed. She is a good, alert watch dog, does not simply bark except for times when stranger is near the house. Understand basic commands like 'sit down', 'come here ' and when to start eating her food, does not bite things or shoes Advantage of adopting adult dog vs puppy: - Adult dogs are mature and character shown, as not all dogs have the character to watch a house (welcoming to all strangers without being alert), however Jolly is an alert watch dog that does not give in to people she is not familiar with. A good watch dog only works well if is not tie up or cage up whole day. - Adult dogs do not chew/ destroy things, not hyperactive or run around as compare to puppies - Female dog does not pee all around the house. They have set boundary for 'pee & poo' area - Adult dogs are more loving, easy to command as compared to puppy, and at this age, they would sit near to you just to watch you doing your things (they love companionship) Me and my husband love her very much, she has kept us feeling safe every night and she is a good company. The reason for us to give her away is due to moving, as the place that we are moving to does not allow us to keep dogs. If you are a dog lover and will not tie up/ cage up the dog whole day, please contact me, thank you\n",

      "Hello, Max-A-Million here! ♥ My rescue story is a rough one. I strayed too far from my mom-cat and like all lost kittens, I meowed / called out for days. Foster mummy heard my meowing from afar. I wasn't aware of it at the time, but she was trying (in vain) to look for me. ♥ Then came one stormy and rainy evening. I somehow found my way to foster mummy's backyard. I called out again, and this time foster mummy came outside, determined to rescue me. Boy did I protest hard when she laid her hands on me...hissing, screaming, biting at her gloves! She eventually wrapped a towel around me and everything went dark. ♥ I was brought to a quiet room, where the scent of kibbles greeted me. There were several bowls of food and fresh water laid out. I didn't stop to think about anything else, I went straight for my first proper meal in days! ♥ I didn't let foster mummy have it easy. The very sight of her walking into the room each day would send me running to a corner (I even urinated a few times out of fear). Still, she remained patient and kept talking to me in a calm voice. She began bringing me treats during each visit and this is when I really started to open up. ♥ Fast forward a week ahead, here I am! Any person who sees / handles me today would find it hard to believe that I was once a wild / feral kitten. I purr at the very SIGHT of people and I LOVE being petted, carried, belly-rubbed, you name it! I'm gentle when I play too (no claws) and my favorites are string-toys and anything bushy / crinkly (dusters, papers, brooms, etc). ♥ Foster mummy has already taken me to the vet for my first full check-up. I was de-wormed and given a clean bill of health. Now I'm ready for that special / permanent family to share my life with! :) *** PLEASE READ: Note For Potential Adopters *** ◘ Max-A-Million would like to be kept INDOORS full-time and NEUTERED at the right age. ◘ Max-A-Million would appreciate some form of premium food (no cheap Whiskas, Friskies, etc). This is for his long-term welfare. If you feel that you may be just the right person to take Max-A-Million home, please drop me an email or text at my number. Details on your past experience with cats will be much appreciated. :) Thank you!\n",

      "I just found and caught a stray kitten at the back of my kitchen. It was raining heavily and the little kitten was all wet and hungry. I waited for hours to see any sign of the mother cat but there is none. So I believe that the little kitten is abandoned by the mother cat. Anyway, I managed to catch the little kitten and currently he/she is in the cage. I am still unable to hold the little kitten as he/she is still afraid of human contact. So, I am unable to know the little kitten's gender yet. My hunch is that the little kitten is a female :) I am looking for any potential adopter who is willing and kind enough to adopt this little kitten. The potential adopter has to be very patience with this little kitten as he/she is afraid of human. I believe that with tender loving care and patience, the little kitten will turn out to be a wonderful companion for the potential adopter. So, if any of the genuine adopter who is willing and able to care for this little kitten, please give me a call . Thank you. 1/3/16 Its been a week since I rescued this kitten and I found out that she's really a female and so I named her ABBIE. She's still wary of strangers but she's comfortable with me to the extend that she allows me to carry her on my lap and clip her nails. I hope that as time progresses, she will be more open to her surroundings and other people. 4/3/16 I think the kitten is male now that I have seen a little 'hump' near his rear end. So I am changing his name from Abbie to Aggie. 😊 9/3/16 Aggie is doing very well and quite playful. Hope he will get a new family soon.\n",

      "We are relocating to Australia and due to strict animal importation laws, we might not be able to take one of our cats with us. We're seeking a potential adopter for the Cream Scottish Fold, while we continue to try our luck to bring the other cat with us. However, if the potential new family could give both cats a wonderful home, we would like both of them to be adopted together. Both cats are very close. They're mother and daughter. Separation will cause some distress to them so we don't want to do that unless it's absolutely necessary. Note: The cat for adoption is 2 years old and is currently recovering from a skin condition. Ideally, she will be better by the time she gets rehomed.. but if she doesn't. The potential adopter must promise to continue treatment. (We will supply the medication) The photo was taken before she fell sick. Below is a video of how she looks like now. (She needs patience from the new family to help her get better if she's not by the time of adoption.) The other cat is 3 years old. Both cats are quite shy and it takes them awhile to get used to strangers. But once they are comfortable with you, they're very sweet cats. All potential adopters will be screened and must agree to keep these cats indoors at all times. (No cages) They are apartment cats and have never been outside their entire lives. They do not know how to hunt and is incapable of killing anything. They are litter trained and don't scratch furniture if they have their large scratching pole and toys, which will be provided by us as well. Location: KLCC area. If you are interested in adopting our cats, please send us an email with a brief introduction about yourself and your family. Where you live (The area) and let us know if you have any current pets. Do include your contact details in your enquiry. ENQUIRIES WITHOUT ANY INFORMATION ABOUT YOURSELF WILL NOT BE ENTERTAINED. *There is a mandatory adoption fee. The money will be donated to PAWs or Metta Cats to help other cats and dogs in need. Some information about the breed: Scottish Folds are not lap cats. They will only come sit close to you or on you when they feel like it. They do however, like laying on their backs to have their belly rubbed. Short-haired Scottish Folds are relatively low maintenance. These cats usually have a bath once a month, and brushed every now and again. (They don't really need to be brushed, but they like it.. so we do it.) Note: The cream coloured SF has a double-fold.. so there are more cartilage in her ears. This means her ears will need regular cleaning. Preferably on a daily basis. If not, 3 times a week would suffice too. The grey cat is more low maintenance. We clean her ears once a month. She's got a single fold, and her ears have lifted.. so there's isn't much of a fold left. We hope that these cats will go to a good permanent home. We're very sad about giving them up. So do not write to us if you intend to adopt just because they are pure breds, they're cute or because your child wants one. Breeding is out of the question as they have been sterilised. These cats will be extremely shy during the transition phase of going to a new home. The new family must have patience with them. Like adopting a real child.. don't expect a cuddle from them or getting them to come to you for a stroke immediately when you take them home. They need time to adjust to a new environment.. which will take 1 to 4 weeks or even longer.. (It depends on how they come to trust you)\n",

      "This handsome fella is named Hunter. He is a very well-behaved, friendly, yet manja boy. He was found on one odd night where it was almost dark -- he was mistaken for another kitten that resided at the fosterer's home sweet home. Hunter, looked almost identical to the kitten, that only when the fosterer reached up to Hunter to have a closer look that she realised it wasn't the kitten! As much as Hunter is very well loved and taken care of by the current fosterer, she is moving abroad and won't be able to fully take care of Hunter as the house has already been resided by three other cats. Hence, Hunter needs a new home. Hunter is allowed to roam free indoor and outdoor (landed property, garden, etc. - he is strictly not to be put in a cage unless for health confinement!). His favourite food consists of dry cat food with occasional wet food. He eats thrice a day, with snacks in between. He was de-wormed and vaccinated on 20th Feb . There is no adoption fee, however adopters need to be serious in adopting and to provide not only home, but to give ♥♥♥♥♥, proper food as well as safety and medical attention to this handsome fella--feline named Hunter.

She's an outdoorsy cat. She's very curious and confident. Has no fear of anything and very playful and active. She's a tomboy so she has no dainty manners. She can probably get along well with dogs and active cats but if you have an existing cat who is gentle, jumpy and scared of stuff I wouldn't recommend her. Ginger will cause your gentle cat a lot of distress. She is about 6 years old. She's blind in one eye because she fell off my balcony as a kitten but it doesn't impair her in any way. She loves people but doesn't really like cuddles. She'll only rub against your legs when she wants food. She is litter trained. Hates pine litter though. She enjoys running around at full speed and enjoys being chased. She eats raw chicken and regular cat kibble. She's well mannered when it comes to human food. Doesn't seem remotely interested in my cooking. She dislikes fish. She loves boxes and being brushed.\n",

      "We took in Marley from a sick gentleman who was unable to care for this puppy. Initially we had someone who adopted her but, soon discovered that the owner is not a suitable candidate to have her. As guardians to this puppy, my husband and i felt that Marley needs a better environment and family. We have a 4-year-old Golden Retriever of our own that we rescued 2 years ago. We follow and practice the techniques of Cesar Millan and we are looking for suitable owners who are familiar with dogs to adopt Marley. Bob Marley is a 6 months old puppy; very playful, intelligent, alert and is a good watch dog. She likes to jog along with the handler. After awhile of getting to know you, you can walk or jog with her without a leash. As an advice, do bring along a leash anyhow. Golden Retriever puppies are hyper but will mellow down as it gets older from age 1 to 2 onward. Still, all dogs have their unique personality which you will come to know in time. This breed needs a cool environment due to its coat. They do well with owners who have big compound and lots of shades. For owners who prefer their dogs living indoor with them, this breed is also suitable for it, provided she can go out 2 to 3 times a day to do her business on grassy land. If you are unsure of this breed, do Google and study about this breed. We love this dog and we sincerely hope to find the best owner for her. Grooming is moderate.\n",

      "Posting on behalf of friend I met her in august 15th, . While one of my friend was eating in some of Chinese restaurant around Puchong, poor mochi was begged for a bit food from customers there, and sadly no one gives it beside my friend, two days later she told me about that and I’m back to that restaurant and look for her in the afternoon but I didn’t meet her there, so I’m keep waiting until night and back again to that area, I’m almost give up because I can’t find her and while we wanted go back my friend saw her in one of restaurant around there. Thus, I decided to keep her, bring to the doctor, have a vaccination, and supply everything she need. I already keep her for almost a month, but again, I can’t keep her forever because no matter how I wanted to my family in Indonesia wouldn’t allow me to bring her back, and now while I’m staying here with others housemate, they don’t like dog. There's no choice but to give her up for a good lovely home. The adopter would have everything that she has now, the cage, food, and toys will be given. Please contact the email above and I will respond as soon as possible. Please spread the words and help this poor puppy. Only responsible adopter will be entertained. HI MOCHI's OWNER HAS DECIDED TO KEEP MOCHI AND BRING HER BACK TO INDONESIA. SO SHE IS NOLONGER AVAILABLE.\n",

      "3 kittens rescued, while the mother is sent for spaying. These 3 kittens are ready for adoption and needs a loving home. Please adopt one or two or all three of them. Currently, we are fostering these kittens for SPCA until the kittens are 2 months old, where they will be returned to SPCA. For adoption costs, please refer to: FEMALE KITTEN – RM (This adoption fee includes a deposit of RM for spaying. This deposit will be refunded once the queen is spayed before it comes on heat, failing which the deposit will be forfeited.) Rescuer Note: Kittens are not ready to be neutered yet until they are 6 months old. It is very important to neuter them when they are ready, as this will prevent them from getting lost. The male cat will wander off your home to find any female cat on heat, while the female cat will wander off when on heat, and will get pregnant. Risk of losing your cat is very high if you don't neuter them. And also your cat may risk injury due to fighting or your furniture will risk damage as well, as un-neutered cats are more aggressive.\n",

      "We found Nondi on a very cold morning after a heavy shower. She was soaking wet and malnourished. We took her in and nursed her, but she was always limping on her right hind leg. From x-ray findings she has a fractured femoral head. She is too young for surgery, but with rest it would heal. She should not jump and run for 2 months. Nondi remains to be a very active kitten, very independant. She is litter tray trained. We are looking for someone to adopt her as we have too many cats. We prefer to give her up to a working Malaysian, no students. We are looking for someone who will vaccinate and neuter her and also take her for regular vet checks. She needs to be kept indoors. For her condition now she should be caged, BUT she hates the cage. So right now she stays in a room but is caged at night. This is only coz we want the fracture to heal. She is very good with our cats and dogs, but mostly she is on her own. Keeping a cat is a commitment for about 15 years and they are children that never grow up and it isn't cheap to keep a pet. Only for serious adopters.\n",

      "Introducing pretty little Emmie! -------------------------------------------------- ♥ Female puppy, 7 months old, has a sleek black & tan coat with floppy ears. ♥ Emmie (just like her already adopted mates Prada and Louis) had a rough start as a puppy. She was locked up and fostered in only a tiny toilet as her \"home\" for 4 months. This is where she ate/slept/poo/pee-ed. She lived with near zero outside world or human contact and this eventually took a toll on her confidence. ♥ Emmie was later rescued (with mange, fleas, and all sorts of physical problems). The biggest damage of all was her broken spirit...she had little to no trust towards humans. -------------------------------------------------- ♥ Emmie has been under proper foster care and all her medical problems have been resolved. She has proven herself to be a very curious and eager girl! She loves to be pet, asks for more, enjoys treats, play and her evening walks. She gets better the more time you spend with her! ♥ Emmie is friendly towards other dogs (only needs a few days to adjust). She is VERY alert and started barking at strangers within just one day of staying at her foster home. She will make a good watch-dog (not a guard dog). ♥ Emmie is a near hassle free girl to care for. :) She is independent, un-demanding, not hyper and never fussy about food. She also knows how to use the grass patch as her \"potty\", no messes. ♥ Emmie is looking for a loving new family who can give her the time, patience and love which she was deprived of as a puppy. -------------------------------------------------- Please read (Note for Adopters): - Emmie should not be leashed or caged (unless it's for very temporary needs). She is a freedom loving girl. Please drop me a call or email if you feel that you may be just the right person to give this darling a second chance. Thank you!\n",

      "Mr Stripey (his temporary foster name) was rescued as part of a 3-kitten all-male litter together with their mother from a backlane opposite my home in early October . and after ensuring that they are in good health and well-socialised after almost 2 months of fostering them, the kittens are now ready to be rehomed. - They are applied with Revolution monthly to protect against fleas, ear mites, heartworms & intestinal worms (dewormed). - Mr Stripey's weight has bloomed from 1.7kg on 11 October to 2.3kg as at 15 November . - They are fed with Evo premium dry kitten kibbles. - I'm feeding them with vet-approved Vetri-DMG liquid supplement to boost their growing development. - They drink water from a bowl which is cleaned and refilled daily to condition the kittens to only take fresh water as outside contaminated water can damage their health and shorten their life. - They're toilet-trained to use the litter box and I'm using Catit premium litter. - Their poop is solid which is a good indication of good bowel health as well as their overall health. - I regularly clean their eyes and noses with saline solution and their ears with Ilium Oticlean. I also trim their nails. Their fur is short but silky clean since they are not allowed outdoors. - Mr Stripey has been vaccinated on 18 October (4-in-1, RM50) with a booster vaccination on 15 November (4-in-1, RM50) at a total cost of RM. - Mr Stripey's behaviour is outgoing and affectionate. He would purr happily when held. The adopter must agree to the following conditions: 1) The adopter must be a Malaysian. However, I will consider an expatriate adopter if you can provide assurances for his future when you return to your home country. 2) He must be kept indoors at all times. 3) You should have a cat cage to confine him for the first few weeks to let him feel secure and get used to your home surroundings. 4) Neuter him when he's old enough at 8 months old. 5) Vaccinate him yearly to protect against diseases. 6) Apply spot-on medication (Revolution recommended) monthly to protect against ticks/fleas/ear mites/intestinal worms/heartworms. 7) The RM adoption fee must be paid in full as it will only cover his vaccination cost. Your adoption fee will help the next needy furkid. If Mr Stripey is adopted with his sibling, Mr Fiesty ( ), there would be a 50% reduction on the second adoption fee. 8) It would be appreciated if the adopter is on Facebook so that we can get pictorial updates on Mr Stripey. 9) Please adopt on a weekend as I'm working full-time on weekdays. If you're interested to adopt Mr Stripey, please sent a message (via petfinder.my) and please share about yourself (Malaysian/expatriate? Working/student?), your place (eg If renting, landlord allows pets? If living with family/friends, do they agree to pets?) and your cat ownership experience. Please don't just provide a phone number because I won't call/sms and prefer to correspond by e-mail first. Looking forward to hearing from you! :)\n",
      "Thank you for adopting my little Noodle. So let me tell u a little about him. We got him at the end April . So his birthday is on 1st of May (labour day). You may find him a bit naughty since we have never caned him. He doesn't really know any tricks at all because he does things his own way and we let him be himself as long as he doesn't annoy us. He was pampered with love and I hope he will get lots of love and attention from you and your family. He is lovely when he has had a walk/ exercise. He can be very clingy to people because he likes to be stroked all the time. Pls make sure you get his hair trimmed around his eyes and paws. He doesn't get along with any other dogs at first, he might bark a lot if he is with the other dogs however once he is used to it then it will be fine. The pics on display are of him when he was looking his best. His hair is a bit shorter now but with a little love and care he can look as cute now as he did then.\n",

      "We are giving Maya away since we couldn't take care of her anymore. Maya is very docile, loving and smart so you don't have to worry when she's with little kids. If you treat her right she will love you to the max she loves to climb on you and give you kisses and smell your scent. She can also be a little rebel if you're no good with her. She's old therefore it's very important that she gets love, good care and attention from her new owner. It would be good if you can keep her in the house or in the house compound instead of in the cage because she's not the kind of cat you keep inside a cage, she'd get depressed and become rebellious. If you love cats who are calm and gentle then you should definitely adopt Maya. Not only she's beautiful but she has a mind of her own too, which makes her very special. If you'd like to adopt her please contact us. Note that most of these pictures below are not recent, Maya is skinnier now but she still looks the same anyway. Self pick up only. Maya is litter trained, and sorry she's not 4 years old, probably 5 - 7 years old we aren't sure because we adopted her from SPCA years ago.

We had her neutered. as after a week of food she went straight on heat, and attracted some very devoted toms, one is still her closest friend. Perhaps we should have had her put down, as we knew we were only here for a few weeks - but she is such a wonderful, affectionate and intelligent creature, we simply couldnt. Please can someone give her a home - she is clean in the house, a joy to have around, a little vocal - her voice is still a bit strange, possibly some Siamese from somewhere - a little needy - with the most amazing huge aquamarine eyes.

[names are all temporary, for convenience] Curly [Male Ginger] Has a curly tail, cute white toe socks and a playful and curious personality. Sort of the 'Big Brother' of the litter, a little bigger than the rest and a outgoing personality to match! Chinaman [Male Ginger] Has unique eyes, and a comparably calmer demeanor compared to Curly, Tiger and Tortoiseshell, but still plays very well with all siblings at playtime 3. Trinity [Female tricolour of white, orange, black] Very playful and energetic, she is the one to initiate play all the time and runs around the most compared to her sibs. Also very fastidious in her cleaning, as I see her clean herself longer than the others do. She has a soft, very prettily coloured coat and white stockings Big Eyes [Female gray tabby] She has a comparatively gentler temperament, and is more on the reserved side like Chinaman, and both like to sit and stare quietly at times, but when it's playtime she runs about with the rest. She has softer fur than the others, and may turn out to have medium rather than short length fur. Tiger [Female gray-brown tabby] The runt of the litter, she is lively, energetic and can be very vocal to compensate for her small size. She keeps up just fine with everyone, and has a rather unique shade of coating, a gray orange hue.

      "\"Hey there! I'm Maximillian a.k.a. Maxi. My previous owner left me behind when he returned to his home country. Luckily a nice neighbour took me in and would like to find me a good home. I really like people - am a big lug of love who enjoys pats really! I'm good with female dogs but not so good with males. A spacious compound to run around in would be great for a strapping young lad like me. I'd love to be taken for daily walks - experienced owner who can handle 40kg of excited dog would be ideal! Oh, and I'm really good during car rides. Any takers for my handsome mug?\" ================================================== Conditions for adoption: 1. No unnecessary tying/caging up. 2. Maintain medical needs (vaccinations, deworming, heartworm prevention etc.) 3. Adoption fee of RM to cover neutering cost and partially cover the cost fosterer has spent on Maxi's care. 4. Allow visits in the initial stages of adoption to ensure dog is adjusting well - for this reason adopters residing in Klang Valley are strongly preferred. 5. Unconditional love :) To help determine if you and the dog you're interested in are a good fit, would appreciate it if you could email/text a brief intro of yourself, your experience with dogs if any, your household situation (what type of home you live in i.e. landed or apartment, whether you have other family members/friends living with you etc.) and any other pertinent info.\n",

      "20 September update: Roma has been adopted by Li of Kajang! Thank you! : D Roma was rescued as part of a 4-kitten litter from a backlane opposite my home on 20 August . After a month of fostering him to ensure that he is in good health and well socialised, he is now ready to be rehomed. - He was dewormed by a vet on 21 August (RM9) & 12 September (RM6) at a total cost of RM15. - He has been treated with Frontline spray on 21 August to protect against fleas for a month. - I'm feeding him with Vetri-DMG liquid supplement at 0.5mL twice a day. - I regularly trimmed his nails, cleaned his face with a saline solution and ears with Ilium Oticlean solution. - His weight is 0.55 kg as at 12 September . - He's eating Earthborn premium dry kitten kibbles. - He drinks water from a bowl which is cleaned and refilled twice a day to condition the kitten to only take fresh water as outside contaminated water can damage his health and shorten his life. - He's toilet-trained to use the litter box and I'm using Ever Clean premium litter. - His poop is solid which is a good indication of good bowel health as well as his overall health. - He has been vaccinated on 12 September at a cost of RM50. - His behaviour is perfect as a pet as he's completely domesticated, playful, curious and affectionate. He would purr happily when held. He's friendly to other cats and kittens (but of course, they must accept him too) as he's well-socialised. The adopter must agree to the following conditions: 1) The adopter must be a Malaysian. However, I will consider an expatriate adopter if you can provide assurances for Roma's future when you return to your home country. 2) Roma must be kept indoors at all times. 3) Vaccinate him yearly to protect against diseases. 4) Apply spot-on medication (Revolution recommended) monthly to protect against ticks/fleas/ear mites/intestinal worms/heartworms. 5) The RM65 adoption fee must be paid in full as it will only cover the vaccination & deworming costs. Your adoption fee will help the next needy furkid. It would be appreciated if the adopter is on Facebook so that we can get pictorial updates on Roma. If possible, adopt Roma at Sunsuria Avenue (same building as Tune Hotel near Sunway Giza Mall), Kota Damansara on a weekend as I'm working on weekdays. If you're interested to adopt Roma, please sent a message (via petfinder.my) and please share about yourself (Malaysian/expatriate? Working/student?), your place (eg If renting, landlord allows pets? If living with family/friends, do they agree to pets?) and your cat ownership experience. Please don't just provide a phone number because I won't call/sms and prefer to correspond by e-mail first. Looking forward to hearing from you! :)\n",

      "Update: Just to clear the doubts, Milo is a MIXED breed. I believe that she was born by a mother of jack russell breed but I can't confirm. Many called in to ask if she is a PURE breed, but sad to say that she is what she is. Whether a pure breed or not, it is still going to be a very good companion dog anyway. She is going thru house training where it is trained to pee/poo on a same spot (old news paper) and not to bite anything that comes into her way (a dog's nature). She is very playful and human friendly. She will definitely loves you with everything she has got if you treat her with love. This one I can guarantee! She is suitable to be kept as a house pet rather than a guard dog (tied up just to guard the house). I believe every single animal on earth deserves to live with freedom, no body likes to be locked up. Those who respect life, loves dog and able to provide love instead of just food and shelter are welcome to adopt Milo. Thanks :) -------------------------------------------------- Rescued from somewhere near my house at Balakong. Found a total of 6 of them yesterday when I drove pass the area. 4 of them felt into a drain and were soaking wet. Me and my wife quickly take them out and found that they were abandoned by a irresponsible owner. They all inherited this jack russell's look leading me to think that they are all from a jack russell mother. Both of them with brown patches around their heads and fully white body. 4 of them were adopted by my neighbours and now left with 2. They are urgently in need of a home as we are only able to foster them until July as we will be away for few weeks for an oversea trip. Besides that, we have got 4 dogs already at home, could not afford to keep another 2 in. I hope some of you dog lovers out there can provide a home for these 2 lovely puppies. They are very healthy and ready to be rehomed. We bought them for first vaccination today and from the guess of the vet, they should be around 1-2 months old. Perfect for someone who is looking for a young puppy where you can start to build the relationship and bonding with them. They are both very active and playful. You may refer to the attached videos :). Thank you very much!\n",

I am going to teach her or him how to properly hide in a box! Please call or email my foster Mommy if you are interested in adopting me. Thank you. Hugs and kisses, Phillipa (Pippa) Important note: I will only let her go to a responsible person who will neuter her when she comes of age dan continues her vaccination as per vet's advice.

      "Indoor cats: I would prefer my cats are kept as indoor cats with space to run around and play. I am very strict about not caging my fur kids and hope you don’t cage them (unless required by vet). Cats are curious animals and are constantly exploring their surroundings. Give them space to walk and run around. But also remember to kitty proof your house. Good Quality Food: My cats are fed some sort of premium brands. Good quality food is important to maintain their health and more beneficial for you in the long run (less vet visits!) Companions: Cats are very social animals and it is healthier to adopt two so they can have another cat to play or interact with. Especially if you are busy at work or otherwise most of the day :). But if you can only get one cat, then please consider adopting an adult cat. Adult cats are usually litter box trained, spayed and easier to take care. Their personality is developed and you know what you get. They are also more independent and mellow in their games and spend a lot of time napping ;). Medical/vets: My cats are not spayed/neutered if less than 6 months. You must agree to do so at 6 months. You must also agree to give booster shots (if required) and yearly veterinary examination. Other Conditions: I love to receive updates on their progress with pictures. Taking care of fur kids is easy. All they need is some food, lots of love & attention and they will be at your side all their life. But before adopting, please consider your financial situation. Good quality food, vet visits, etc will need to be budgeted.\n",

      "[Appeal from Phoebe] I am seeking your help in housing two female puppies that are abandoned on purpose at Japanese Garden, in GreenLane. They are about 1 to 2 months old. They take refuge in MPPP storeroom at the garden next to the community hall. One of them was spanked by someone according to a resident in the neighborhood. Sometimes, they take refuge in a drain hole in the pavement for fear of certain people. Now the Head of MPPP threatened he would rang the dog catchers here to remove the 2 puppies. My biggest fear is the rest of the strays will be caught and killed as well. I knew of this because I feed some strays (some with and some without license) in the area. I afraid these two puppies will be in danger as no one is willing to look after them let alone adopt them. Many vehicles pass by that street daily. I couldn't take the puppies as I live in a flat.

      "Dear all, these are two female puppies that I have found by the side of a busy road on my way to work. I couldn't leave them there knowing what would eventually happen to them....so I brought them home. The state of our country is such that most shelters are barely surviving with minimal funds. Therefore I am trying to find them loving homes on my own. I would love to keep them myself but I already have four dogs. My neighbours are not very happy and asking me to 'buang' as if they are some unwanted rubbish( apparently they are not as compassionate as I would like them to be). I have checked with the local authority and I was told that there can only be four dogs per household and I may keep more if the neighbours don't complain but if they do they will remove all the dogs and put them to sleep (may not be the case, perhaps they were just trying to scare me).I now run the risk of losing all my dogs but I still believe I can find these puppies loving home with your help.

Blue kitten!' That's my fav color! its hard to find a blue kitten/cat nowadays unless they are British Short hair or Russian blue. the reason i want to let her go even i really2 want to keep her are: 1. am a student 2. am a wife 3. am a missy to my mom, shes a strokee 4. we got 6 cats already nothing much i know bout this BlueCHEESE ;). 24 hours with her just tell me she: 1. never meows 2. not scared when being bath 3. so manja, likes to purrr, likes to be hugg 4. most of her body covered with muscle, NO fat. so she is quite heavy 5. the coat is so pretty especially under the lights as the coat starts to look like Velvet. it shines and is really2 soft when touch 6. she has 2 big round cooper eyes 7. she got a wrinkle tail just like wrinkle fries ;) 8. she is SOLID BLUE but there is a small white patch under the tummy~ very low white The person that adopt her must SPAY her. its a must! i will ask from time to time as i do not want her to get into a wrong home. Adoption fee will be charged of RM10. whom ever is willing to pay for her then the person is willing to take care of her. (my experience for giving rescue kittens for free turns out not a happy ending for them ~ who will appreciate something for free?!) The person must live in Selangor or Kuala Lumpur only.

But no one has come to claim him :( He is really loving, sweet and playful, and just wants someone to manja and sayang him. He is quite fluffy and gebu, so we think he might be a medium hair cat when he grows up. The pictures don't do him justice, but he has a really sweet face and personality. To be honest, we have fallen a little in love with him, but we already have 2 cats and have allergies, so we can't keep him. Please, if you are looking for a loving, playful and smart kitten to be part of your family, contact us and come and see him. Otherwise we'll have to take him to Paws :( ----- Story: We found an orange tabby kitten in Damansara Utama. He was hiding from another mother cat who was being very aggressive because she was near her kittens. We think he might be looking for his mother and just went near this cat, hoping for someone to take care or sayang him. He was shivering, limping slightly and had an ear pierced with a metal wire that was already turning rusty. So kesian.. We took him to the vet, who removed the piercing because it was hurting him. Good news, only minor injuries which are now healing nicely. We also dewormed and de-flea him. He was wearing a pink tag with the name \"NUR MAISARAH\" written on it. We are looking for his owner, or someone to adopt him. Please contact us by 13 May or we'll have to send him to Paws :( Thank you!\n",

      "Truffle, a black velvet Bombay cat with a gentle and calm personality, was unfortunately dumped outside the Malaysian Nature Society office in Jalan Kelantan together with her son, Tinker. We have gotten the both of them neutered and now need to find them a good home, especially since there is a risk that they will not get fed at night or on weekends when there is no-one at the MNS office. If possible, please adopt the two of them together, as they are very close to each other. Truffle is the wise, quiet (yet no less affectionate!) one, while Tinker is the playful, active one in this partnership.\n"

      "About 3+ weeks ago a cat walked up 4 flights of stairs to my apartment and decided to have 3 kittens behind and under my TV table. Being a cat and all animal lover I thought poor thing, it must have been frightened or felt uncomfortable where she “lived” so decided to come have her kittens in my place. I also assumed she belonged to one of my many neighbours who apparently are “cat lovers or owners”….. the ones who let their cats run about and poo all over the condo area stinking up the area. Anyway I have provided mother and kittens with a safe and clean place to stay. The mother comes and goes, presumably to her owner or to look for food and do her business. Assuming she “belongs” to one of my neighbours I have put up signs on all blocks with pictures attached for the owner to come collect their bundle of fun, also saying “if you don’t I will have offer them up for adoption and/or send them all to SPCA. To date I have not had any replies to my posters. Lately the mother cat does not come back as often as she should and I’m doing my best to “feed” them. I never planned to keep them but just give them temporary shelter till someone claims them or the mother sorts herself out and returns to her own accommodation/owner or starts paying rent :-) Now I offer them to any cat lover/owners. Next step will be to SPCA or any other animal shelter. Attached are some pictures of these adorable kittens. Please contact me if you would like to own these cute furry long tail kittens as I can’t keep them.\n",

      "Female Pregnant cat looking for a carer/home. This pretty girl cat suddenly appeared at my house, and I have been feeding her for a few months, (other than feeding another black kitty). Her tummy seems to be growing bigger and i felt it last night and am thinking she is pregnant already, which is why i am anxious to get her adopted/taken away from this area as last night i witnessed my neighbour trying to kick and throw things at her. *sad* On top of that, I am is also migrating in August, so poor kitty would have no feeder after that. She is very friendly to humans and other cats, but has weak hind legs (either deformed from birth or due to a beating). She currently sleeps in their porch under my car most days, and I feed her twice a day. She looks to be ready to give birth soon, and i really don’t want her to go into some neighbour’s house and have her litter there. (We all know what that scenario would be like). She is located in Balik Pulau, but I would be able to bring her to adopters anywhere on the island. I am also willing to provide some sponsor for her care (and her kitten’s care)\n",

      "This puppy is: 1. Female 2. 2 months + old 3. Black and mixture of Brown in colour 4. very cute, healthy and active 5. In Penang A lot of people will think that female dogs will dirty the place or cause male dogs to come when they have period. In actual fact, once the female dogs are spayed, they will not have period any more.(The spaying cost is not expensive if you go for government vet). Moreover, my experience is female dogs are easier to be trained for toileting. The conditions for adoption are: 1. Deworm and vaccinate it immediately after you adopt it. 2. Spay it when it's 6 months old if you do not want to see abandoned puppies. 3. Treat the puppy with love and make it be part of your family.\n",
      "I dunno how I ended up in this world. One day I was suddenly snatched from my mommy and was dumped to an old market ALONE! There were a few other abandoned pups there too.

We were showered, deticked and fed well with salmon keebles, goat milk, yogurt and fish oil. Initially, my gums are almost white and tummy bloated. But now pinkish and fit. One day we were brought to an afoption drive. Many were being adopted. Then auddenly a specky sweet girl came and laid eyes on me. She wanted to adopt me! I was so overly joyed to finally found a new home. Paper works were all done. She said she will come back after lunch. Minutes were like hours. I anxiously waited. After almost an hour I saw her comjng! Jumping with joy. Suddenly I saw her face turned sad. She said her mom rejected. My world came tumbling down... I was thinking am I going back to the market or other place to wonder on my own? Restlessly I followed my rescuer home. But I was not abandoned again. My rescuer will be away for almost a week in the next 2 days. I am praying hard someone is willing to adopt me... pleae please please... My rescuer taught me how to SIT & DOWN. I follow my rescuer running unleashed. I am playful. I sleep quietly throughout the night.\n",

      "Gus was found in my neighborhood in mid-January . He was weak, wheezing and flea-infested. The vet says that he was quite small for his age, and not healthy enough to get vaccinated. Ultrasound scans show that his intestines have very thick lining, explaining why he was small (malabsorption) and had loose stool (maldigestion). After a few rounds of medication and gastro-intestinal kibbles, he's much better now. His coat is smooth and shinny. He has good appetite and his poop is normal now. He's been de-flea, dewormed, vaccinated (1st dose only), and castrated. He's tested negative for FIV and FeLV. Gus has short-medium coat. He has a particularly long and fluffy tail. The vet says that there might be some Maine Coon background as Gus has an oblong build. He's a loving cat with good temperament. He loves to sleep on my hand/arm while I work on the computer. He recognize people and can be wary of strangers. But warms up to people after some playtime together. He spends his days eating, sleeping and playing in my office. His recent favorite toy is a piece of palm leaf [see video: Gus vs Leaf]. --> WHAT IS GUS LOOKING FOR\n",

      "Meet Hari, Ashok and Rash. These three are always brimming with energy and playfulness. They don’t have much manners though. They can be verbally abusive if you are late to greet them or come without any treats for them. They have absolutely no respect for personal space of others. Always snooping into my bags and sometimes car to see what they can loot off with. But they are good problem solvers, if they see me looking really confused with biscuits in my hand (thinking in what order to give them out), they help me by snatching the whole pack and happily distributing that among themselves. But they wait for me every morning at the gate to greet me without fail and when I am leaving work they see me off. They follow my car for a short distance too. These caring boys never let me walk in the farm alone. I would love for them to be a part of some families. Location: Ulu Tiram, Johor. Text/Whatsapp\n",

      "Hi, my cat has 3 kittens up for adoption. I am unable to take care of so many cats as I'm always out of house due to work so I'm looking for kind, caring people to take care of them and want to have their own cats as pets as soon as possible. The third one is D-Trick, the smartest of the bunch as he had learnt to eat and used the litter box the fastest. Though he is quite a talker, he is friendly and will warm up to you once you get close to him. They are able to eat wet and dried food. But for now, mostly wet food and slowly introduce them to dried ones. D-Trick can already use the litter box, so he is toilet trained and won't make messes. If interested in one, or more of them, please call/sms me at or email me. Unfortunately I don't have whatsapp, but if you need any additional pictures to be sent, please let me know your emails and I'll send them over.\n",

      "Hi cute-looking human, I was found by my rescuer hungry and wet, and I was not sure what happened to my mother. Thank you to my rescuer for taking me in, and nurturing me to such a healthy and pretty girl. Now I need a permanent home, as my rescuer said that I am now ready to find more love in new home. I am very friendly, lovable, loved to be hugged, and I loved to lie down and relax on your warm lap. You could hold me as long as you want, hug me, and look deeply at me, and I enjoy these very much. Please give me a permanent home so that I can be your best friend. Please call/Whatsapp or to adopt me. Rescuer Note: Blackie is not ready to be neutered yet until she is 6 months old. It is very important to neuter her when she is ready, as this will prevent her from getting lost, as she will wander off your home to find any male cat when she is on heat. Not only you risk of losing of your best friend, you will also risk producing many more homeless kittens on the road or someone backyard. These kittens will died eventually. Please neuter to save lives! Update - Brought her for vaccination.\n",

      "Lucy was found under a car on a rainy day. The car was about to reverse and run over her when we spotted her and ran to stop the car from moving. We took her home and fed her as she was malnourished when we found her at 1 month old. She seemed to be eating well and seemed very happy but then 2 days later we found out she had contracted the Parvo virus. Complicated by her malnourishment she was in dire need of medical attention and was hospitalized and put on drips for 5 days. After she was released from hospital she had gotten over the worst of the parvo but still very weak and needed special care. Even through all the pain she never failed to wag her tail and smile at us whenever we were with her. She was a real fighter! We fed her high quality kibble to make sure she would bulk up but the virus seemed to have restricted her growth. Now after 2 months of intensive care, good food and love, Lucy is now a healthy, happy, slender puppy who shows no signs of the struggle she had in her early life. She loves to play and snuggle with you on the floor and is still the same happy go lucky girl she always was, always ready to greet you with a smile and a tail wag. She's very quite and friendly to people and animals alike. She's now looking for a home where she can grow into a well loved pup! If interested PLEASE do give us a call or email us. She has been vaccinated and up to date with deworming.\n",

      "A mama cat (stray) recently gave birth to three cute little kittens in my office factory. Would love for the three little kittens to have a good home instead of roaming around this factory area (dangerous as there are many heavy vehicles and a lot of traffic). There are two mixed colours (grey and white) - one male, one female, and one tabby - female. [Edit: Two of the white ones have been adopted (yay!) - only the female tabby left (dark brown).] There are no adoption fees but the adopter must agree to the following conditions: 1. Spay/neuter the cat once it is old enough. 2. Vaccinate the cat(s) yearly. 3. Strongly encouraged to apply spot-on (deflea) medication once in a while to protect the cat (and also yourself) against parasites. If you are interested please send me a text/call/email and explain a little bit about your previous experience (even if none) with cats.\n",

      "Snow is a stray found in a small town an hour away from Kuala Lumpur. Abandoned there as a puppy with her mom (who died when she was knocked down by a car), Snow has been roaming the streets on her own. She is gentle in nature, loves affection, and would be a good indoor/outdoor dog. Smart and trainable! Ideal home would give her plenty of freedom to move around in the house compound or indoors, take her for regular walks and provide heart worm prevention. Snow will be a great companion for other dogs! She can play with younger ones, and at the same time gentle and mild mannered enough for old dogs too! Photos don't do her justice! Come view her and fall in love with this sweet girl. Snow has been spayed on 17 August , and has received her first vaccination too! Potential adopter is expected to consent to a house check (to ensure the place is proper and suitable for keeping a pet) and also send us updates on how she's doing. No fees will be charged for the adoption, though should the new family want to reimburse the neutering fees, that would be welcomed, or just pay it forward by contributing any amount to your favourite animal shelter or TNRM efforts.\n",

      "I am trying to help 7 puppies find their foster/forever homes. Please help if you can offer a loving home for one or more of them, and can committed to loving and caring for them for life. They are probably 2-3 months old, I can't really tell, very friendly and playful, needless to say, extremely adorable. Their mother is owned by a security guard and is tethered to a little guard station in Bandar Seri Damansara area. She gave birth to 12 puppies and the security guard did his best to feed and take care of them, but only managed to get 5 adopted so far. Leaving 7 puppies with their mama, mostly unsupervised, by the side of a street. They have reached the age where they are getting more and more curious everyday and are starting to venture a little bit farther from their mama each day. Other than the obvious danger, outdoor is no place for these puppies to grow up (with the constant rain etc, they will also need to be dewormed, vaccinated, and spayed/neutered). We bought a 30 pound bag of good quality dog food for the guard to lighten his financial burden of having to feed these many puppies and to give the nursing mama some much needed nutrients, but it will not last long. A friend who lives nearby has promised to check on them and give them treats when he jogs/drives by. We have also left a few toys for them to hopefully keep them entertained and keep them away from the street and from wandering too far away. If you are in the area, or know anyone who is thinking of getting a pet, or have connections to rescue groups, please share the pictures of these puppies and help them find their permanent/foster homes. The security guard can be found at Jalan Damar SD15/3 guard house and can be reached at . Rescues are the best breed! For every dog you adopt, you save two lives - the lucky guy who gets to go home with you, and you free up a space so that another dog gets saved from life on the streets. Thanks!\n",

      "Madeleine was rescued by the kind people of Malaysian Dogs Deserve Better (MDDB) last week. She had been caught by municipal council dog catchers along with a large group of other dogs and puppies and was being held at the MPK (Majlis Perbandaran Klang) Dog Pound. Little Maddie is now staying with my during her rehabilitation. Her time at the pound was quite traumatizing and she had some insecurity issues and fear. She's a sweet, and friendly puppy now, eager to please and learn. She loves the company of people and her new friend Molly Sue. Maddie has been through some very rough times in her young life, i expect adopters to be patient and extra gentle with her. She needs to trust you and feel safe. Maddie doesn't like to be alone so it would be great if she could be adopted by someone with another friendly dog or someone that has time to spend at home. At the moment i am paper-training her because I am not home enough to expect her to be completely housebroken. I think Maddie may grow up to be quite a big dog so adopter should have space for her to run around in and time to take her for walks. vaccinations and spaying are compulsory for adoption. cost of these procedures to be borne by adopter. no caging, no tying up, no beating. adoption procedure for interested parties: - set up a meeting with me and maddie. - see if you and maddie get along. - i'll ask you some questions to make sure you are suitable for each other. - finally, meet up at my vet to pick up maddie and vaccinate her, then you can bring her home. interested parties can sms/call me at or Wani from MDDB at. You may also email me. serious inquiries only please. a brief introduction of yourself and a description of your experience with dogs is appreciated.\n",

      "Fluffy is a 5-month-old female rescue kitten which is currently being fostered and is now seeking a forever home. She has blue eyes, and white, medium-length fur with some calico colouring. Fluffy is currently an indoor-only cat, and isn't caged or confined. Like almost all cats her age, she is adept with using her litter box. She is a kitten from a community cat which I have been feeding. When she was rescued at the age of 3 months, she was underweight and hadn't yet been vaccinated and dewormed. She's now been vaccinated and dewormed, and is at a healthy weight and is an active and healthy kitten. Due to her age, however, she isn't yet spayed and her adopter is expected to do so at the appropriate age. For those who prefer cats which aren't noisy and don't demand a lot of attention, Fluffy would make an excellent pet.\n",

He's healthy and is on antibiotics for treatment of ticks for the next ten days before going for vaccination. Aside from slight anemia and being quite timid at this point (but who can blame him!) he is very easy to take care of. At two months he's already starting to come into a big personality - he's very playful and loves being cuddled. We found him on 31st Oct. and on the 1st of November, he pretty much learned how to obey the command \"No\". Smart little guy!!! Sadly we already have two rescued dogs... and both of them are feeling very depressed at the moment because they feel threatened that this little bundle of joy will replace them. It wouldn't be fair on them to keep little Steve so I am hoping that we can find him a really loving family who will shower him with only the best attention and love.

      "2 months ago, this small skinny black puppy (with a streak of white on her chest) under a car with serious maggots infested head injury was found. With the help of a vet, we have nursed her to good health and the wound has healed. She is now around 3 1/2 months old. We named her Blessed as she is a blessing to whichever home she goes to. She is easy to look after and does not bark unnecessarily. She is toilet trained to do it on underpad indoor at the moment, as advised by the vet; we have to separate her from other dogs during her healing period. She is such a fighter against all odds despite the serious injury at such an early tender age of her life. She is growing up to be a beautiful and loving girl. Blessed is being place with a fosterer pending rehoming. Unfortunately, the kind fosterer has just been told by her landlord to have all the dogs removed from the house immediately or to vacate the house by this week (28/4/13). As such, we are seeking kind adopter to give Blessed a chance to have a loving home immediately after having just a hard life on the street. Please call/sms WM Cheong ( )\n",
      "Very grateful that after a week of interview and meet up with all potential adopter, all six babies found their home with lotsa loves! Thank you to all who choose adoption instead of buying :) --------------------------------------------- Free adoption but vaccinations and neutering surgery for the puppies are a MUST. We will follow up with adopters for the vaccinations and help to schedule neutering surgery when the pups are old enough. **** IMPORTANT!! **** % of puppies make a lot of noises and cry a lot for the first few days or weeks when being adopted. Because they're being separated from their mother and siblings and also unfamiliar with the new environment. They are % exactly like a small little human babe - cry when they wanna pee and poo, when they feel hungry or because of insecure, and YES - for sure they will cry in midnight time. Adopter need to understand that and please only adopt when you're ready to spend time and energy in raising them up. For sure puppies are cute BUT at the same time they are not easy to take care of too. **** **** **** **** **** We named the mommy dog Moomoo. Yesterday midnight she was found sitting weakly at the roadside, heavy breathing, drooling, no appetite, having high fever, stiff muscle and couldn't stand or walk properly. We sent to vet clinic immediately and found that she suffered from deficiency of blood calcium after giving birth. Immediate treatment was given and her condition been stabilized today but she's still very weak. We went back to her colony and found 6 of her babies hiding under a car. Moomoo're not allowed to feed her babies anymore if not she will lack of calcium again. We took all 6 babies home and taking care of the mom and babies in different places now. We really need to find all the babies a forever home filled with love and care urgently. Please, ADOPT instead of buying. A home means a lot to them. Interested to adopt? Please kindly read our requirements: - No tying/caging for long period - On leash when bring dog out - Keep dog indoor all the time - Agree to bring pet for yearly vaccination - Provide balanced meals and fresh water all the time - Allow for home visit - Love and treat them like your own precious family members Please give a home to Moomoo's babies ♥\n",

Very affectionate (manja), no matter how I shoo him away he keeps on coming begging to be given attention :) and he is also obedient, he listened when I said he can't come into the house.

My funds are extremely limited. - I do appreciate photos after a successful adoption! Vaccinations and neutering/spaying at 6 months of age are compulsory for adoption. There are already too many stray homeless animals starving and suffering in the streets.. Please don't breed. When you want more pets, you can always ADOPT from a shelter. No cage confinement please, except in incidences of illness or injury. Tabatha is very sociable, playful, fun-loving, and energetic. Confining her in a small space would make her very unhappy. Interested parties may text or email me. A brief introduction of yourself and your experience with cats is greatly appreciated.\n",

And when we leave, Coffee will escort us to the car, seeing him standing there in the rear-view mirror as we drove off breaks our hearts every time.. Living outside the food court, Coffee and his brother Milo are often being bullied and beaten by the food court employee. They were abandoned there when they were pups, despite not getting enough food, they are always being beaten by the food court staff, they stayed on, as that is the only place they know. Young Coffee is extremely trusting and friendly like any pups should. Coffee is neutered, vaccinated, deticked and dewormed. However, due to shortage of place to keep them, Coffee and his brother Milo had to be released to the food court after visit to the vet. The heavy traffic and unfriendly human around is not a safe place for these sweet pups. We pray for the kind person to give this poor kid a real home before it's too late...

      "As we are leaving Malaysia we cannot take two of our three dogs with us, and Rosie is one of them. She came to us two years ago when she was roaming the street, having been abandoned or thrown out by her previous owner. She then decided to adopt us (yep - she waited in front of our gate every day until we took her in) and has since been the reason for many laughs. Even though she must have had bad experiences before she is very trusting and curious and I have never seen her aggressive towards people. She will always try to stay close to one of us. Although she is very alert she rarely barks and is generally very calm. She has learned some commands but needs some additional training to listen really well. Rosie would be ideal for a family with kids as she is very gentle and patient. She is currently living inside the house as well as outside in the garden, so please no small cages or chain for her. Even though we leave the dogs alone during the days she has never chewed or destroyed anything. I hope a new family can give her the life and love she deserves. What this dog lacks in beauty, she makes up in cheerfulness and personality!\n",

      "Spike was rescued from a drain as a little puppy, his mother was a stray living in a jungle area with her pups and he happened to be the lucky one to fall in our drain! Unfortunately we are moving to a house without a compound for Spike to roam happy and free as he has always done. He loves lying in the sun and is a rather shy dog - we take his wild beginnings into account for his nature. He is best suited in a one dog home, with an owner who will love him for his Marmaduke/Dingo uniqueness. Spike may look tough, but he's just a big old softy at heart. We hope to find him a family soon for him to love and be loved by them. We will provide his new family with a starter pack of his food, lead and bowl. Please contact me if you have a little room for Spike.\n",

      "Kiddo was found roaming the land around Telaga Harbour Marina in Langkawi. When I first approached her she eyed me nervously but once I had spoken to her for a while and assured her I meant no harm and only wanted to help she came up to me and gave me the best kisses and cuddles! She had a hole under one armpit that was starting to fester and was very skinny and full of fleas. The fact that she did not run away and was so quick to trust means that she was probably not a wild dog from the area but rather an abandoned pet :( This lovely little lady now stays with me and 12 other dogs. She is well socialized, I have two cats as well and she is very confident around people. She is now at full health, full of energy and has so much love to give!\n",

      "This here is Molek! (story background) We found her, her siblings (all 6 of them) and her mummy under an abandoned car in front of a 99 speed mart in Bandar Sunway. Our family came over daily to feed the mummy dog as our initial plan was to wait till all of them are old enough to eat kibbles and put them up for adoption and neuter the mummy dog. However, very very unfortunately, 2 of her siblings fell into a longkang and drowned while one probably wondered abit too far out and got run over by a car. We knew then that we needed to step in and help them! So we took them in. So far, we have managed to get 5 of them adopted and they are so loved and happy! We hope for a happy ending for Molek too! (if you are wondering why we don't just take her in as our own, its cause we already have a lot of dogs, we started out as fosters but ended up adopting many of our foster dogs and now we really cannot take in anymore and it would be unfair for them because we can't give them the attention and affection that they truly deserve!) Sorry for the long winded story, so here is Molek, waiting for a furrrever home. She's extremely bright! Playful, active, sweet and loving! She mixes well with other dogs (benefits of being around other foster dogs)! She's a great guard dog too! And a major plus point is she's up to date with all her vaccines and she is neuter (save u the trouble)! We're located in klang valley pj area, very close to Sunway Pyramid! Do not hesitate to contact me if you are interested. The best way to get me would be via telephone! Thank you for viewing ^_^\n",

      "Four male puppies for adoption. We rescued the mother and her four puppies from an empty shop house. There were originally seven puppies, three were beaten to death.

      "Found this lost Pomeranian in my neighborhood. He is a male and around 4 to 5-year-old. Can't take in another dog as I already have a Shih Tzu of my own. Will put him up for adoption if cannot find his owner in 7 days. If anyone is interested to adopt him please send me an e-mail. This dog is well taken care of by his previous owner, nails are trimmed, no ticks nor fleas and he doesn't bark much. He is potty-trained too. He pees and poos outside the house. UPDATE (17 June, ): Re-captured Bravo in the neighbourhood. He looked tired and weary. This doggie has a habit of escaping by jumping through the high gate and window after getting warm shower, food, and shelter (for a night or two) from the rescuer. He has made \"Running Away\" his lifetime profession and it really broke our hearts. Thus, we have no choice but to put him up for adoption. We do not believe in caging or putting a leash on the dogs. In Bravo's case, it is different. If we are not careful, he'll escape once again (he's a good jumper). Today we brought him to the nearby vet to check if he has a microchip embedded in his body. But the scanner couldn't locate any. Therefore any attempt to find the original owner is futile. (In addition, I believe its master also gave up long time ago on a runaway delinquent like Bravo.) So if you are STILL interested to adopt Bravo, please contact me. Breeders’ requests will not be entertained. We’ll scan through all the prospective candidates to find Bravo a good home. UPDATE (18 June, ): Due to overwhelming responses and my phone number becoming a hotline, I have decided to post up my questions (here) for those who are interested to adopt Bravo. Please e-mail your reply to me. Do NOT post your answers in the comments section. 1) Name: 2) Phone: 3) E-mail: 4) Age: 5) Profession: 6) Do you live in your own property? (Yes/No) 7) Do you stay in a house/flat/apartment/condo? 8) Will there be someone at home when you are away for work or school? 9) Do you have a pet of your own? (Pet's details - Name, age, dog/cat, spayed, etc.) 10) Do you cage your pets? Why? 11) If your pet doesn't want to eat its food, what will you do? 12) How are you going to manage or take care of a dog which makes \"Running Away\" its lifetime profession?\n",

      "They were born at the vet when a kind rescuer rescued their mother Coco. The mum found a home along with their brother Panther. They were adopted twice but they have had unsuitable adopters. After that they were moved to a fosterer's house, who is no longer available to keep them. They both feel they are not loved or wanted. They may look big in size, but are very sweet and loving. They are also able to follow simple commands, sit, down, etc and are in the midst of learning more. It would be great if they can be adopted together but they are independent enough to be separated. So interest in either are welcome. I am not the fosterer or the rescuer, but am helping my friend to get them adopted. I personally agree that they can be very sweet and are quite trainable if you spend some time with them. If you have the hearts and space for this two fellas, do contact this number ) or message me.

Missy is perfect for old people as she's a kitty who doesn't require much attention. All she asks is to allow her to accompany you and let her be in the same room with you. However, Missy is part feral so her nature is aggresive and territorial with other cats. So if you're considering on getting ONE cat, she's perfect for you. But not advisable for people who already have another cat or planning to have more than one cat. Missy also has 4 babies (4 months old) up for adoption.\n",

You should have experience and basic knowledge about dogs. 2)No kids under the age of 12 unless the parents are able to give correct guidance to their kids and Munchkin. 3)Munchkin gets along well with other dogs bit also needs correct guidance and supervision.

      "Tinka has been with our family since she was a puppy. Now we are moving abroad and out of our three dogs we can only take one with us. Therefore we are looking for a loving home for her. With her shiny black coat she looks quite impressive, but she is a gentle creature when it comes to people. We have always felt very safe with her around. Tinka has attended dog trainings and knows the basic commands. She loves to learn new things and show her skills, and if she gets a praise for it - even better! although she makes an excellent guard dog she spends a great deal of the day being lazy and just being happy to be around someone. Her ideal family takes her out on walks and makes her part of the family (one of her happy days was when she \"convinced\" me that she was allowed to watch TV on the couch with me). In return she will be very loyal and watch out for her family. She doesn't like cats and needs some time to get used to other dogs. She was fine with our other two dogs, and I never had a problem taking her to the vet or leaving her at the kennel when we went away, but there are a few dogs in our neighborhood that she does not approve of. We currently allow her to be inside the house as well as in the garden, so please don't keep her in a small cage or on a chain all day long. Staying alone during the day has never been a problem We really hope that there is someone out there who will take her in (maybe even together with Rosie) and give her the life she deserves\n",

They are both quit brave and can be made as good watch dogs and also as pets as well. If interested please contact. DOn;t hesitate to call of you have further questions regarding the puppies.

People also can touch him now. Since he's been living as a stray and not use to play with humans especially cat's toys, he has his own way of playing. He has a grey-blue solid colour fur without any black/white spot/stripe. His tail is a bit twisted. Love to sleep. Love to talk ( meow to be exact ). Love attention. He love me to garu-garu him behind his neck. He's still has a habit which kinda making a marking territory. But worry not, he did not spray any urine. Just the tail is a bit rattling, like snake's tail. It's a habit I guess since he's been doing it since his first heat. Give him time and he'll be a better cat or even the best cat ever.

She is a perfect candidate for a family guarding dog because she can protect the house and her territory as she can warn owners of nearby strangers approaching.

Joos has been to hikes to waterfalls and top of mountains and she responds very well to adventure in the jungle.

      "We were walking in the Georgetown city centre on a Friday night () and came across a poor little ginger kitten. It was malnourished and had a virus so bad that I initially thought it was abused. We offered it food and water but it was too weak to accept it. We knew that it would most likely die of hunger with the state it was in, so we brought it to the veterinary clinic. Since then we have nursed it back to health and brought it back to KL with us. What I have noticed that it is like no other streetcat I've seen before - friendly, cuddly, curious, supercool, overall a lovely character. You may have heard it all before but he is quite a special one! He is now fully recovered from his wounds. We have also dewormed and defleaed him, and his fur is purrfectly beautiful. We are now progressing him with the best vaccination possible. We need to leave the country within the next 2 weeks, so we urgently need to find him wonderful owners who will love him and take care of him. Ginger's hobbies are: football, hunting, extended naps with humans, cuddle big time, getting bellyrubs, and eating!\n",

      "California showed up at my front porch in June but my cat-owning neighbours do not know who she belongs to so she's likely dumped. As a result, I decided to spay her and rehome her since she's still young. - She has no tail deformity unlike most other domestic cats. - She was dewormed by a vet on 20 June . - She has been applied with Revolution on 5 August to protect her against ticks, fleas, ear mites, heartworms & intestinal worms for a month. - Her weight is 4.15 kg as at 7 August , a gain of 0.65kg since 10 July . - I'm feeding her with premium dry cat kibbles. - She can drink water from a bowl which is cleaned and refilled twice a day to condition the cat to only take fresh water as outside contaminated water can damage her health and shorten her life. - She's toilet-trained to use the litter box and I'm using pine litter which is good for her (& human's) health and the environment. - Her poop is solid which is a good indication of good bowel health as well as her overall health. - She has been spayed on 28 June at a cost of RM. - She has been vaccinated on 10 July at a cost of RM50. - Booster vaccination and deworming on 7 August at a cost of RM68. The adopter must agree to the following conditions: 1) The adopter must be a Malaysian. 2) The cat must be kept indoors at all times. 3) Vaccinate her yearly to protect against diseases. 4) Apply spot-on medication (Revolution recommended) monthly to protect against ticks/fleas/ear mites/intestinal worms/heartworms. 5) The RM50 adoption fee must be paid in full as it will only partially cover the RM spaying, vaccination & deworming costs which I'm subsidising. Your adoption fee will help the next needy furkid. If you're interested to adopt California, please sent a message (via petfinder.my) and please share about yourself (Malaysian/expatriate? Working/student?), your place (eg If renting, landlord allows pets? If living with family/friends, do they agree to pets?) and your cat ownership experience. Please don't just provide a phone number because I won't call/sms and prefer to correspond by e-mail first.\n",

      "Swagger is a bright, confident little kitten looking for a loving active family to take him to their hearts. He was picked up at a local mamak restaurant, where he had been dumped by a family. When I took him in, Swagger was skinny, dull and just wanted to sleep all the time, but with lots of food and lots of love he has blossomed into a playful affectionate kitten! Swagger loves his tin-foil ball, his mouse toy and a little bit of gentle wrestling. He also really loves his food and bowl of milk. A curious and adventurous animal, he loves exploring the world around him, but in the evening when he's exhausted he also likes to sleep on laps. When he gets excited, his beautiful long tail fluffs up like a mini Christmas tree. He likes to be scratched under the chin, and especially loves to have someone rub his white furry tummy. A great purrer, Swagger is also an accomplished kisser of noses. Swagger is toilet trained, clean, a good eater and a pleasant, well-mannered kitten, suitable for children and adults. Update May : Dear little Swagger got adopted on Mother's Day and was taken away to his forever home. Good luck, happy kitten!\n",

      "Gigi is a healthy young female calico cat. She was neutered early and is fully vaccinated. She's house trained and litter box trained She loves attention, rolling on the floor waiting to be tummy tickled. ! She has the sweetest meow and comes running when called by her name. However this all has to be earned through trust and a calm approach as she is a little timid and skittish since she was a rescue previously. So her new family should be preferably older children / adults , not small children . Also to be in a non cat household as she will tend to fend off other cats as her self defence. She is best kept indoors / fenced compound for her own protection . Do you have that special place for Gigi in your lives ? Please will you be her forever family.\n",

      "I almost knocked down this kitten yesterday afternoon while driving a car (22-Nov-). I took it and brought this cute kitten to a nearby animal clinic to be examined right away. The doctor confirmed it was a male kitten, between the ages of two months, and after examination, the doctor confirmed it was in healthy condition. Cat flea medication was given. In good faith, our family is unable to care for this kitten because it was too small, moreover, my wife and I work on long day, while the children are in college. This kitten needs someone who can give greater attention to him. And we already have a big male cat and a rabbit. We fear we can not provide love and care to this kitten. By the way I name him \"TWENITU\", because I met him on the / :-) So, I appeal to anyone who is willing to take care of TWENITU to contact me. In the meantime, I will make sure it is in good health and the doctor advised me to bring it back to the clinic after a week for the vaccine etc. Thank you.\n",

All have been toilet trained to use pinewood. He is hyperactive and will turn toys into shredded pieces. He is the ring leader of the litter. Adoption fee will be discounted if taken as a pair with his sibling, Toby.\n",
      "He is called Jellybean because he has always been small in size but strong in character and very, very sweet. He enjoys climbing up onto your shoulder to sniffle your hair and nibble your ear. He grew up with 4 bigger brothers and could not compete with them for milk and space while baby. So he was always the smallest and sickly one. His right eye still looks wonky due to his sickly babyhood. The vet says that he might out grow it as he matures. But if not, it can be corrected (but not necessary). But he is healthy and active now in spite of his wonky right eye. In fact, to make up for his small size, he has grown a big \"I-can-do-it\" attitude and is often the leader of his bigger brothers showing them new places to explore and new games to play. And because of his sickly babyhood, he had developed a very positive outlook in life - whatever happens he will still go, \"Yay! Happy, happy.\" He is a well-socialized intelligent kitty because he got the double privilege of growing up with brothers and a mother cat and got regular daily hand-feeding by various kind people since babyhood. So he gets along cheerfully with cats and humans. He loves to play with the kids in the neighbourhood. Born on 15 Nov , he is brother to Caramel and Muffin: And brother to Cupcake and Cookie: It would be ideal if he could be adopted together with Cupcake and Cookie because they are now very close to each other. Some important info: * Checked by vet and de-worm treatment was done on 6 December and 6 Jan . * Vaccinated on 20 Jan - 1st jab. * Vaccinated on 24 Feb - 2nd jab * Next vaccination jab is on 24 March . * On 6 Jan - he weighs over g. On 20 Jan , he weighs g. On 24 Feb , he weighs 1.6kg. * Frontline anti-flea spray treatment was applied on 23 Feb . * Able to eat solid food - kibble, wet cat food and chicken. * Litter-box trained. * The adopter has to make sure that he gets regular good fresh food. * The adopter has to make sure that he is neutered when he reaches 6 months old to ensure that he gets a good chance at a long healthy life. Please email or sms me if you are interested to adopt. Give your name, where you live and work and the reason why you want to adopt.

They are still very young and need a tremendous amount of care and affection. Note: 1 puppy was adopted in late July . GENUINE ADOPTERS ONLY - If you are thinking of adopting puppies, I urge you, do not think of adopting them based on \"beauty\" and \"cuteness\". Dogs will mature (obviously) so their \"cute puppy\" factor will soon be gone, but they can be your steadfast companions for a significant number of years. They will be a lot of work to look after, but they will give you a lot of affection and happiness in return. I humbly request a small adoption fee of RM50 per puppy as I had them dewormed and deticked at the vets, though this fee is not compulsory. Note: I do not know what breed these puppies are, nor how large they will grow to. I put \"medium-size\" based on the size of their mother.\n",

Mei Xin jie jie is a very sweet girl and she will be playing with me when I get to my new home.I love her too! That's why mummy decided to let me live with them. _______________________________________________ Faith was a little tiny puppy when I found her wandering around.She had a bald tip tail and hind legs and could not walk properly thus we believed she was ill-treated from home and had no proper nutrition. So we brought her home and sent her to the vet. The vet said she was about 1 month plus old then. She was given medicine and dewormed but not heart guard as she was too tiny. She's now healed with LOTS OF HAIR!! and very healthy. We are a couple staying in a rented home with neighbours who complain about our dogs let free in the compound.Therefore Faith lives in a cage whenever we're off to work and out of home. I am now not working but will soon be working again. Also, due to our financial status, we're not able to to provide proper nutrition to all the animals thus we have decided to let go Faith the youngest dog which needs the nutrition and a proper growing envinroment most. Faith is toilet trained and she's fleas/ticks/mites free. TOILET TRAINED - She might let go at the wrong place due to new environment. ------------------------------------------------- Dear Wonderful pet lovers, I have received many calls regarding Faith this whole day and am happy to know that there are so many of you out there who are interested in adopting her. There's a question I must answer to every phone call and I should state it here clearly. YES,ADOPTING FAITH IS FREE! YOUR PRICE TO PAY IS TO GIVE MY LITTLE MONSTER PROPER CARE AND A LOVING HOME. Please also note that Faith is a growing puppy therefore she's very playful and active - running around.This is the only thing I am worried about. If you're interested, pls call me anytime to arrange for a meet up with her.\n",

      "Profile Ringkas: Name: Mama Kin Age: Adult cat.Probably 1 year and half. Condition: Healthy and Pregnant (Probably will deliver in early May). Believed that this is not the first time she is pregnant. Characteristics: Adorable. Soft. Very affectionate dan sangat manja. Likes to purr a lot. Likes to roll her self on the floor:) Sangat comel bila dia golek-golekkan badan dia atas lantai;) Likes to clean herself frequently. Even with a bulging stomach, she is still a playful mama and like to play:) Why she needs to be adopted asap: Cause the Cat Catcher of my hostel block has started their cat cat catching operation and they may take Mama Kin away to unknown-unsafe place..worse, according to the Cat Catcher,the cats that they have captured will be taken to the zoo negara. Mama Kin's story: Mama Kin is a stray cat that came to my hostel block about two months ago, out of nowhere, right after Mega and her kids have left us. When we started to approach Mama Kin, we noticed that she is an adult cat and she is also pregnant. Without any bias or judgment, yet with with warm hearts, we welcome her to our lives and to this hostel block. Kami namakan dia Mama Kin sebab kaki dia ada 'white spots' that make her looks as if dia pakai stokin;) She is a pretty, adorable and cute pregnant mummy cat. She has been a very good and affectionate cat too. Dia sangat manja. She likes to purr a lot every time I play with her, caress her head, stroke her fur and give her some food. Despite the fact that we love having her around, we know that \"some people\" don't like it. Dan \"some people\" yang dimaksudkan di sini ialah \"the hostel management people\". Just like other cases of cats in this hostel block, we do fear that Mama Kin will be taken away by the Cat Catcher assigned by the hostel management sooner or later. Kalau kucing-kucing ini diambil dan dibawa ke tempat seperti SPCA ke, saya tak kisah. But the Cat Catcher once told me that the cats that he has captured will be brought to zoo negara or somewhere unknown. I totally don't want these cats to be taken to zoo negara or anywhere else that's not safe. Therefore, me and my friends realize that one day we need to find Mama Kin a new owner and release her from this \"cat hater\" place. So, we at first plan to give her away for adoption after she has given birth. Unfortunately, the day that we fear has come. This morning, the Cat Catcher came to my hostel and he and the team searched high and low for any cats, just any cats whether it's the one that has been neutered or not. However, thank God, Alhamdulillah and I'm so grateful that some of my friends who are also cat lovers managed to act quickly and managed to save and hide other cats in some rooms and Mama Kin is now hiding in my room. And this is not the end. They will come again soon cause they know, the cats that they are searching for are not captured today. With all this panic moment and in such dangerous state, I think I can't wait until Mama Kin has delivered. I can't wait after her delivery. It's going to take longer time and her life is 'at stake' now, if I may put it that way. So, I'm putting up Mama Kin's profile in here, so that anybody who's a true cat lover, kind-hearted, considerate and caring out there could have the heart to adopt her. Please... Yes, she is pregnant. And the person who would love to adopt her must be the one who is prepared and ready for new comers. If that person doesn't plan to have them all, perhaps you could be patient for awhile and later, you could give them away for adoption once the kittens are big enough. I'm searching for someone who really really appreciates cats whether they are adults or kittens. Why I say this is because, when I 'advertise' Mega and her kitten not long ago,I found out some people like to have the kittens yet abandon the mother. There was this one couple who intended to adopt Mega and one of her kittens. Tapi this couple told me that they live in an apartment. So what they plan to do is to keep the kitten but put Mega downstairs with other stray cats. Kalau macam tu, apa guna saya iklankan untuk Mega di'adopt'. Baik saya 'buang' saja Mega ke zoo negara seperti yang dilakukan oleh Cat Catcher di hostel block saya ni. So, basically, all I'm asking and hoping for is to have a cat lover who is responsible and caring to take good care of the pregnant and adorable Mama Kin which deserves to feel loved and be happy in a safer place, as soon as possible. That's all. Please... Thank you=)\n",

      "ADOPTION FEE IS AN OPTIONAL CONTRIBUTION TO OUR RESCUE EFFORT. Pearly was surrendered to us by a family who admitted to neglecting her. They often caged her and chained her up, rarely taking her out for walks and providing her with little stimulation. As a result, Pearly needed mental rehabilitation when she came to us. After only a month, Pearly is much more stable and better socialised. She has learned to play with other dogs but does not mix well with dogs (or humans) that are hyperactive or overly excitable. She is timid with strangers but becomes attached to people easily, soon following them all around the house. Pearly must be kept primarily indoors even though she loves daily walks.\n",

So his ONLY suitable to be an indoor baby. - His very calm, toilet trained and he eats & drinks well. He has never been ill before. Most importantly Casper has been neutered, so rest well new owner. He love to be with others. Let he come to trust u, then he'll cling to u more often - His still a baby, not even a year OLD. So kitten food is recommended. Just until he reach 1 year old soon. - He loves to play. Love to be around others. Always looking TOO ADORABLE. - Reason to let go: i'm moving to a new places that DOESN'T ALLOW me to bring the boys. So it breaks my heart to actually undergo this process. I hope to find them a new loving parents. - For more info - Contact me : Nyuu - Pick up around Shah Alam area.\n",
      "Hi all.. Thanks to the very loving and kind Cell, Meyer has found a forever home. Also thanks to fosterer, Lynette who made sure that Meyer is \"READY\" before moving in with his new family. Another happy ending for a sweetie pie!!\n",
      "Hi everyone! My name is Pinky and i'm about 3 weeks old now. My foster mummy Lyn found me all alone in the driveway of a vacant house on jalan sri hartamas 2 on saturday september 12 after receiving a phonecall about an abandoned kitten. I was curled up in a tight ball and didn't move when she touched me and spoke to me. I was covered in filth and looked dead. The lady that called her about me told her that my siblings and cat mummy used to all live in that empty house together but then my mummy moved away and took my siblings with her.. i think she forgot about me. the people in the house next door watched and waited for her to come back but she didnt.. that's when they called for help because they knew i was dying. I have been with my foster mummy for almost 2 weeks now and i'm feeling much better though i haven't grown much. I'm still too thin and i don't like the kitten milk formula very much. I really hate the milk bottle so i have to be syringe fed for now. I hope my teeth grow soon so I can start eating yummy canned kitten food and kibble! Mummy Lyn wants to keep me forever but she can't coz she has soooo many pets now. I hope someone will adopt me and love me like she does. I should be able to go to my new home in about 3 to 4 weeks, once i am completely weaned and litter trained. Mummy lyn wants me to be healthy, so my new parents will have to pay for my vaccinations and they must neuter me because there are already too many homeless hungry kittens like me struggling in the streets and suffering.. For adoption to a safe and loving home. Preferably INDOOR only. Vaccinations and neutering at 6 months are COMPULSORY. NO CAGE CONFINEMENT please unless during instances of illness or injury. Adoption procedure: - Set up a meeting with me and Pinky. - See if potential adopter and Pinky are suitable for each other. I will ask some questions to make sure adopter is suitable. - Succesful adopter will then have to meet us at my vet in order to get Pinky vaccinated before being able to take Pinky home. Cost of vaccination and neutering to be borne by adopter. - I might occasionally ask adopter for updates to see how Pinky is doing. Interested parties can sms, or email me. Serious enquiries only please. A description of yourself and your experience with cats is greatly appreciated. UPDATE: Pinky started eating Hill's prescription diet A/D yesterday (/09)through a syringe. He used the litter box for the first time by himself on /09. We're so pleased!\n",

Pinky is very sweet and friendly, loves to be cuddled and be around people. Give her some TLC and she is sure to repay you with all her love. There are a few requirements we are looking in the adopter for Pinky: Her trademark little pink tongue may need a touch of care, requiring sufficient water throughout the day to keep it moist.

She ran out from the roadside very quickly to the middle of the road and our car nearly hit her. She's a super beautiful tiger striped girl with innocent big round eyes. Bambi is very intelligent also. She knows to pee and poo most of the time on rag and newspaper without training. But she's a very manja girl and love to stick with human, when she can't see any people around her she will feel insecure and cry. But when you're with her, she will just be very quiet and sit or sleep beside you. A very sweet little baby! Adopter need to be patient with her at the beginning as she's still a little baby now, she can be trained to be independent after a period.

      "Little Hailey had a rough beginning to her life. Hailey was rescued about 2 months ago in Desa Sri Hartamas. She was a lone pup most likely abandoned. Hailey was close to death when she was rescued. Severely malnourished and anemic she could barely stand. She had major hookworm infestation and the worse case of fleas I had ever seen. It was heartbreaking to see such a tiny little dog endure so much. Her blood count was so low that a blood transfusion was needed. But like her vet says..Hailey is a fighter and a survivor! She was such a good patient throughout her treatment and rehabilitation. It was so easy to administer her meds and when she got her appetite back she would eat anything I fed her..no complaints, no rejection . Thankfully, she is now a happy and healthy girl. She is also very intelligent. She learned the commands sit and down in a day and would go back to her cage when she's instructed to. Although it breaks my heart to give her up for adoption, I feel she deserves much more than what a condo habitat can offer. Hailey received her first vaccination a few days ago and is due for her 2nd in a month. Her adoption is only open to genuine dog lovers who will take her in as part of the family . Adopter must agree to spay her in February before her first heat. If you are keen on giving Hailey her forever loving home, please contact Kin at.\n",

      "Update 27 Oct : on Saturday 25 Oct , Boy went to Central Park, Desa Park City and he was having a lot of fun running and walking around the lake for about 2 hours. He took the opportunity socializing with other dogs and humans. What a day for Boy. He is still looking for adopter to provide him with a loving home. I will provide the leash, collar, food tray to successful adopter. Info on Boy : 1. He is about 1 year old Mongrel; 2. Very playful and understands basic commands; 3. Suitable as Guard Dog for the whole family; 4. Vaccinated (9 in 1) and Dewormed. Currently on monthly heartworm prescription.; 5. He loves treats very much. Not a fan of kibbles but sometimes he would still take it. He loves wet canned food and consume between 2 - 3 cans a day. My conditions : 1. I will only release Boy to adopter who can provide him a loving home. I will not release him to adopters who want him to guard factory, shops, office ect; 2. Please do not tie him up unnecessarily at home as he is used to walk/run free around my house compound; He is on leash only when I take him out for a walk; 3. Please try your best to walk him daily for his exercise; 4. Boy has been trained not to enter my house. He has been trained to stay outdoor but free to be anywhere he wants around the house compound. Therefore, please spend sometimes with him daily at least a couple of hours; 5. To continue giving him his scheduled vaccination and other normal medications prescribed for canines; 6. Last but not least, again, must provide him with a loving home. 7. Should Boy is adopted by you and later you found him not suitable or you are not able to provide him with love, please return Boy back to me. Thank you. ---------------------------------- Update 23 Oct : It has been about 1.5 months Boy has been under our care. It was really fun having him around us. We brought him to Central Park, One Utama the other day and Boy demonstrated his gentleness towards other dogs and humans who came to see him. It was a happy day for me to see Boy was enjoying his day at the Park. It is sad for me to give him away but I am not able to keep him permanently. And before Boy and I get too attached with other, I seek those who can provide Boy with a loving home to contact me asap. ----------------------- Update 17 Oct : Boy will be joining an event \"I Want To Touch a Dog\" at Central Park, One Utama on Sunday 19 October . He will be there as a Volunteer. If you're joining the event, please look up for him and say hello. Boy has now fully recovered from his injury. Boy still looking for a loving home. ----------------------- Update 6 Oct : Boy is now a \"legal\" resident. Obtained license for him at MPSJ. Now he is proud resident of Subang Jaya. Boy still looking for a loving home. ---------------------- Update 5 Oct : Boy has almost recovered from his injury and now is really playful and wonderful dog. Just brought him to the vet for a 9-in-1 vaccination today. For last couple of days he learned to play \"fetch\" and loves playing \"soccer\" with my kids. Just uploaded a new video of him playing \"fetch\" ----------------------- Playful Boy up for adoption. Very loyal and listen to your command. Give him a chance and he will be with you for life. Boy (this is what I call him) came to my house gate on Saturday morning 13 September looking scared and hungry and he was limping a bit due to swollen front left leg. I believe he had been hit by a moving vehicle or could have been hit by someone. Since I pity him, I fed him with my cat food and let him drink a lot of water. He was very cautious when I approached him. To cut long story short, he finally decided to enter my house compound and I have decided to provide him with shelter and food until he is ok or find a new home. I am not sure if he was a stray dog but he had no collar when he came to my house. I find him very gentle and too smart to be stray. he does not simply bark although the other dogs in the area are barking. Up todate he has become an excellent companion. This afternoon (Monday 22 Sep) a Vet came to my house just to check him up. Since he was afraid with the doctor, we were not able to vaccinate him. However, I have given him pills for deworming and pain killer for his swollen leg. Due to circumstances, I am not able to keep him permanently although it would be sad for me to let him go. I pray to God, a good samaritan would want to adopt him and provide him with a loving home. Please call me if you are the owner or interested to adopt or foster him. May God bless you.\n",

My dog has been neglected so I have decided to give him to a better family to take care of him. He is an indoor dog so please dont leave him outside the house. Casper is a very active dog. He likes to play with ball and will play fetch with the owner. Somehow, due to lack of bringing him to walk he often felt insecure when he reached new places and he will pee to do marking.

      "Rescued husky,was dumped by neighbor due to his health conditions (maggot,skin problem) & thin. Now he's fine after extra care & treated for 2 months! (Treat under Lian Animal Clinic, Klang) It got microchip too. It have beautiful blue eyes. Active and energetic ! Loves outdoor & need time bring for walk once/twice a day (love running). He pull on leash as it natural for husky. Can be train because I tried before and still need more training. Skin sensitive(itching) still need care or treatment. Husky a large breed dog need a little of space. Husky is not as easy as you think. He don't obey anything you ask. If you loyal to it , he'll sure listen to you. Because he obey my parents than me. He good with kids too. Please take note, as mention he have maggot wound which is at his private part/ball. That wound is fully healed but recently we just found out there's red spot spotted under it ball which is diff area than his previous wound. Doctor doubt that in his last treatment didn't clean his wound properly which caused a chance that there might be another maggot. It can be cure by taking oral medication as his previous maggot wound healed after few weeks time. Its a shame that owner abandon this beautiful dog and I couldn't handle 2 dogs because I have Jack Russell & small space plus my old man don't really like big dog. Can only keep him until end of this month. Hope it can find the right owner soon as I not able to keep him for long. I don't want it end up in SPCA. I have tried my best and did what I had to do for helping this husky. Hope either of you who's good hearted can take care & love him forever. Please do not adopt if you are looking for PEDIGREE as this dog here need forever loving home. And for the dog medical fee purpose a minimum fee as stated above will be charge for adoption.

      "♥ Coco, 8 weeks old, tortie-lynx point with blotches of gray / cream / white and blue eyes. Father was a Ragdoll and mother is an American Curl (given up by previous owners while pregnant). ♥ Coco is a sweet-pea and has a true inherited Ragdoll nature where she goes limp if carried! She can likely be taught to be a lap-kitten, enjoys strokes and being baby-talked. She is the best climber and learns things real quick! Loves toys (especially feathered ones) and adventure - she also has an odd-obsession with watching us cleaning out the litter box (and sometimes getting in there to \"help\" us). ♥ She's already had his first vaccination and deworming. Not fussy about kibble or wet food and is very clever with the litter box! ***IMPORTANT: Note For Potential Adopters*** - Coco must be kept INDOORS at all times. Apartments must be cat-safe. - She's been raised since birth on a grain-free healthy diet and this must be maintained (no Whiskas, Friskies, etc).

      "Rescued at the Esso Petrol Station near TK1 Puchong Morning Market. She is small [approx. 1'(L) x 8\"(H)], weighs 11kg, chewy, soft brown eyes, short brown coat, mild & gentle temperament. Her medical needs are currently taken care of by me. She is fed with rice mixed with Pedigree dog food. Fresh water always available. She normally eases herself only when taken for walks. Chewy at the moment, could do with giving her toys. She has need of assurance of love and care at times, so it's good to give her some hugs now and then. Timid due to the fact that most of the bigger dogs in the area usually attack her. Her yelps got my attention, otherwise I might not have noticed a pup there! Serious dog fosterer can call me as I am also looking for a fosterer while seeing to it that she gets a proper home. Serious pet owners (non-violent), please call me at (Puchong, Selangor) to view puppy. If want to take her, please ensure that she's cared for from start, in sickness and in health, til death do you part from each other. I will not want to surrender her to someone who cares for her, and then drop her off at some marketplace later on.\n",

      "On / i have rescued a small puppy approximately 2 months old male mongrel, a car was about to hit him when the puppy was trying to go across the road. Luckily for the puppy he managed to dodge the in coming car just in time. The puppy was so shaken and i decided to bring him home for temporary care, he was so hungry that he finish up all the food in just seconds and of course after the meal it was time to take a good and nice hot bath. I was unable to care for this puppy for long time as i'm staying at a apartment and i have a 9 months old female mongrel dog with me, which i rescue her 6 months ago when her owner decided to leave her alone by the road side. To my surprise my female dog seems to enjoy the male puppy company, well maybe they share the same fate as a mongrel and stray around by the roadside and so my female dog decided to treat the small male puppy nice. The puppy was a very active dog, he likes to follow me around where ever i go and when i keep him in a cage or when he does not see me around for a short period of time he whine and whine until he fall asleep. Anyway i sincerely hope that someone can adopt the male puppy and give him a nice warm home.. . anyone who is interested,sincere and serious to give the puppy a new home can contact me anytime, please find below my detail.thank you\n",
      "Hello. Meet Tookins, who reinvents herself from a traumatised stray to a techno savvy kitten. She is about 3-4 weeks old. She is an adorable Calico with a stumpy tail that wiggles when she is super happy. I found her in the middle of a busy road, too scared to move. Luckily she was not hurt. Just shocked. Even from that first encounter, I knew that she is one lovable kitty. Her hobbies include playing with anything that moves, glows or just plain old bits of paper. She loves cuddling to her Mrs Bunny, her bff. Tookins is a natural-born cuddler and a lap kitty. Also a shoulder kitty. Out of all her long list of repetoires, she is also a Youtube and Netflix bingewatcher. She loves teenage movies with good villains in it. Tookins has been checked by the vet and she has been given a clean bill of health. She has been dewormed and deloused (Advocate). She cannot be vaccinated yet as she is so tiny according to the vet. Tookins eats boiled tuna, Whiskas Kitten pouch food and Royal Canin Kitten. She is fully toilet trained and at the moment stays indoors at all times for health and safety reasons. As you can see, she is well loved by my family. As a kitten rescuer and fosterer though, I am willing to share my love for her with a responsible forever family who will care for her unconditionally. If I found her a good home, I can rescue more kittens in need. There is no adoption fee. All I am asking is for Tookins' future mom or dad to: 1. NEUTER her as soon as she can be safely neutered. 2. Make sure her VACCINATIONS are up-to-date 3. Provide her with everything she needs to stay safe, comfortable and happy for the rest of her life. So if you are looking for a quirky, fun-loving, cuddly and not to mention super adorable wee fluff, look no further, for Tookins is your kind of kitten. Please do not hesitate to send me a message. I will then give you a questionaire to be filled in. Thank you. Nini\n",

      "Dingo was rescued when he and his sibling fell into a monsoon drain. Unfortunately I am unable to rescue his sibling who went into hiding the drain after I rescued Dingo. Momma dog was there barking for her babies and as soon I came she ran away as she was terrified. Went back 15min later to try to rescue the puppy by baiting him w food but alas he was nowhere to be found. And so was momma dog. Fast forward to today, Dingo is a notti lil fella always teasing my momma cat whenever she tries to eat! And lovingly biting my other kittens and pulling them by their ears! Compared to te 1st day he was rescued, he is more playful and bouncy (fat). He is still a bit shy and will hide underneath my bed but once I put him on my bed, he start frolicking and jumping on my bed w my cats n kittens! As with many living beings, it will take time to adjust and adapt to a new environment. So if you are willing to spend some time w this lil mutt (or piggy) and teaching him to human environment (although 2months in the street is consider a short time but it does affect one character), do msged me w these details: your name, area and name of pet (Dingo) and also your queries.

      "Hello everyone, We are giving putting up both our cars for adoption/sale of anything you would call it as we will be migrating out of the country and it is a great loss to us having to let these two angels go.Both are totally the opposite where Pepper loves to give you love but doesn't like to accept hugs for more than 30 seconds and Sabre loves everything. Both have been vaccinated and are in good health.Both are females not neutered and a great companions and have never been kept in a cage before as they sleep with us everyday. They are disciplined and have been fed with Evo and Royal canine. since they were kittens they were both brought up with Baphaer. The tabby is name Pepper 1 year 3 months and the little Silver is name Sabre 9months now. We are looking for a good home for the two of them and would love to get a caring guardian who would love them as we do. It's a sad moment for us as they had never been out and mixed with many people before except for visitors at our place so you will need to be patient for them to get close to you especially Pepper. We I'll be charging a fee of for each of them and you may let us know if it is fine for both.Contact us at anytime and we will bring them to you.\n",

      "I have 2 dogs, both unwanted pups which I adopted. 3 days ago, my uncle asked me to take in another pup. Today, someone in my vicinity complained to Mpsj that I'm having 3 dogs & I got a warning that I'll be compounded within 3 days. My pets & compounds are clean, well behaved and licenced, but some ppl are just plain nasty. Miji is very manja and a small eater. She can understand commands like sit, hand, get in the cage, wait, kiss, hug and carry. She is also very alert, thus makes a good guard. I thought since she's spayed and vaccinated, she'll stand a better chance to be adopted as the new owner won't need to pay more than her annual jabs. But if someone rather take the 4 months old puppy, pls call too. I wish I can rescue all 3 of them, but I will be breaking the rules. I hope a kind hearted person who likes small dog will respond ASAP and will treat Miji well. Please help before Mpsj comes again.\n",

      "I took in the mother as a pregnant stray, and she gave birth to these three wonderful adorable kittens. No adoption fees, just hoping that the adopter can provide them with proper love and attention that they deserve. My location is in Taman Melawati, KL. Would recommend interested parties to come see them first before deciding, as I will not be \"delivering\" them to any location in case of backouts. Priority to be given to anyone who can rehome all three kittens without seperating them, but individual adoptions are welcome too. NOTE : THESE ARE NOT BREED CATS, just regular Domestic Short Haired cats... but love needs no pedigree, right? :)\n",

      "Hey everyone! Klover was rescued by my mom and I from a street nearby my place. We fell for her the moment we saw her because she was unlike any other stray dogs to us. Klover has the brightest of eyes and the most alarming German Shepherd like ears! Though we were strangers to her at first, she kept coming close to us with her head nudging our legs asking for a pat on her head, in her way :) We took Klover home becuz we wanted to look for a home for her to live in. The outside can be extremely dangerous and we would not allow her to be caught by the authorities. My mom and I wish to take her under our care permanently but we can't do that because we're living in a condo. It would be mean of us to keep her in such a small area because she's big and more of an outdoorsy doggy. She is of camel and kangaroo brown colour with a white chest. Klover is very loving and passionate towards her caretakers. Throughout her stay here with us, she has been with me from accompanying me whenever I nap to accompanying me whenever I do my study revisions. Klover is rather playful and always opts for a belly rub. She doesn't make much noise as she doesn't bark much. However Klover girl would make this doggy ''purr'' whenever she loses sight of you. That purr literally melts my heart everytime :) Klover deserves a family who is able to give her lots of love and care. She would be better off living in a house with a compound bcuz after all that is one of the main aspects we're looking for in a home for her. I'm also pretty sure she'll do well with a family with kids. Gentle Klover is a total sweetheart, I can guarantee you that. She's so sweet and very loyal. All Klover needs is a good home :)\n",

      "Introducing Kayla! _________________________________________________ Details: ♥ Female, 10 months old, Irish Wolfhound + Border Collie mix. She has a rough medium length coat (black and white). ♥ Kayla is under foster care as her family had to travel overseas due to unforeseen circumstances. Kayla is now seeking a permanent new family. _________________________________________________ Character: ♥ Kayla is an intelligent and high energy dog. She loves taking walks (especially running around fields, beaches, hiking, etc). If you're an active person, she will happily tag along on a leash as you do your daily runs/cycling/etc. :) ♥ DESPITE her energy; Kayla is a VERY calm dog when indoors! She will only get onto beds/sofas if invited and otherwise makes herself comfy where she can. ♥ Kayla understands a few commands like \"sit\", \"stay\" and \"shake\". She was also trained to wait for her food and walk off leash by her previous owners (however I have not followed up on this during the period of foster care). ♥ She has an amazing temperament too! Gets along well with dogs (cats also if she sees them indoors/as part of the family. Kayla is especially patient and loving around children, She's the type of dog that would lie in bed with the kids and keep them feeling safe/protected. ♥ Kayla requires NO grooming whatsoever as her fur stays the length it already is. She also hardly \"smells\" and only needs a bath once a month at most if indoors (unless she's really had a muddy run somewhere or rolled where she shouldn't). ♥ Kayla loves water too! She will half-sit in a pool, even chase after water sprinkling out of a hose. :) ♥ Potty habits; When indoors, Kayla will bark 3 - 4 times in a row to let her people know she needs to be let out to do her business. She appreciates routine daily walks (at least once in the morning, another in the evening before bedtime). ♥ Kayla is fully vaccinated (rabies shots included). She is also spayed, parasite free and micro-chipped. She is not fussy about food either. _________________________________________________ *** PLEASE READ (Note for potential adopters) *** ♥ Kayla takes time to adjust to new people (at least 2 weeks to trust). She will bond closely to anyone who pays the most attention to her. She will accept \"firm\" tones when being trained but NO rough tones/scolding of any kind. ♥ Kayla likes being indoors % EXCEPT when she needs to be taken out for some form of activity. Adopters practicing this are preferred. ♥ Kayla needs round the clock attention (she will get anxious if left crated any longer than 4 hours a day). Adopters with lots of time on their hands are her best preference. ♥ An adoption fee will apply to cover Kayla's basic care (please inquire). Her cards will be passed to successful adopters. :) _________________________________________________ Please drop me a call or email if interested in taking this girl home. Details on your past experience with dogs will be much appreciated. Thank you!\n",

      "You can contact me through whatsapp/line to know about the cat. Conditions For Adopting : 1. No first time adopters without experience. Friendly first Time adopters with experience are welcome. 2. Keep in contact.Please send me picture of her every now and then.I want to be assured that she's fine and growing well. 3. Be absolutely sure that you will commit to her before adopting. 4. I will try to converse with you a bit before giving her because I want to know the adopter's background. About the kitty : This is a female kitten. She was wandering outside at the opposite neighbor's house. and I accidentally called out to her and didn't expect her to come in running. Just came in and made herself home. She is a veryyyyy friendly kitten. She is the first kitten I didn't had to try to tame. WE found who the mother cat is. The mom came in and checked on her for 3 days and bit farewell. The mom trusts us. Compared to the other kittens we have had, she is the most gentle one. She plays but not naughty. This little kitty is a bit greedy in eating but good thing is that she's not violent. She's quite intelligent. When it comes to food. Knows every sign food is coming. Doesn't scratch or bite...or haven't learned to yet (only happens when we let). Gets friendly with the big cats very fast. So if you have other cats, won't be a problem. I'd love to keep her but everyday before I go to bed I have to shut her outside the house. She spends the whole day inside and at night I feel bad shutting her outside and seeing her desperately trying to come back inside...I'm not given other choices. So that's why she's up for adoption. I'm not allowed to keep her. I don't want her to become a stray cat. She pees and poops on grass.Sometimes she goes on her own and other times she scratches and jumps on our legs to ask us to bring her to the toilet grass). When she wants to pee, her tail fur stands up and it looks like brush while meowing a lot. aaaaand you gotta love that face of hers.\n",

Initially I thought he was a lost dog but judging from his heavily matted fur and how thin he looks - I think he has been a stray for quite a while. I spoke to a food vendor in my area and she said she saw him wandering in the neighbourhood quite a while now. He is fine with the collar and leash, quite friendly but fierce as well - he barks at strangers - so he'd make quite a good guard dog. Please contact me with a brief description of yourself and household. Thank you. UPDATE: Brought to the vet. Male, has some skin infection (yeast) and an ear infection - using medicated shampoo and he should be fine after a few baths. Apart from that he is fine. Need a home for this boy soon!\n",

      "Found wandering around my friend's apartment complex. He was bullied and thrown around by some of the resident children. In spite of this he bears no ill-will toward people. He is frisky, playful, and affectionate. On his first day with us he willingly sat on our laps and settled down for a comfortable and cosy nap. This little guy will do well in a home with another playful cat. Tuna is an INDOOR cat. The outside world is dangerous, and he has already suffered at the hands of ignorant people. Zero to minimal cage confinement please. This kitten is very playful and energetic and needs lots of space to run around. Keeping him in a cage would be cruel. Vaccinations and neutering are COMPULSORY for adoption. Succesful adopter will have to reimburse me for these procedures at which point i will hand over his medical booklet.

      "Thank God for sending a lovely family that fits the descrption of our ideal fosterer, and would do what i listed below for the dogs! Timtams are now part of a loving family of parents +3kids+a maid and loving the wonderful corner house with grass in the compound! ----- TimTams (one is Tim, one is Tam)- to make it easier to call them! Potential adopters should be able to commit to: 1) walking the dogs 2x a day (or keep them in secured bungalow/semi-d/corner house with vast area to roam, as they love running and playing) 2) spend time playing with them (they're still quite young, and will whine for attention unless given regular affection-time with keeper) 3) give fresh water daily & proper food (they eat kibbles) 4) keep shoes in proper shoe cabinet cos one of them is still displaying puppy behaviour of chewing shoes or moving them around (unless he gets adequate exercise and attention) They appear to be brothers, and was roaming Ara Damansara area when found. Plus points about these dogs: 1) trainable: know how to sit/shakehand/come 2) loves children and will play with kids - excellent FAMILY PETs! 3) chase cats (but don't attack them) 4) will bark at strangers - good alert dogs! 5) friendly to keeper and friends 6) great with older folks because of gentle nature - makes excellent FAMIlY PETs! 7) get along with other dogs, even male dogs (possibly because not fully sexually mature and also very gentle + playful in nature), so can join family with existing dogs. NOTE: Will only entertain genuine adopters who'd take either one or both dogs as family pets. They get along well with other dogs. Tim once ran up to an Alsation in my neighbourhood and I thought he'd be minced meat, but they got along fine! Tam was badly injured (possibly by other dogs) when he was rescued, so he'd need responsible owners who'd make sure he's kept in a safe environment.\n",

My husband and I are often outstation to care for them properly. So I am hoping for anyone kind enough who want to take them in. The person just must be able to give them a good home. They are very adorable with quite thick fur (for a local domestic cat) and very playful. One of them have short tail while the other two have long tails. Those interested please call me at or. Please call me after 8pm.\n",

She is housebroken, and will only do her business outside. Very affectionate with her master and wary of strangers, excellent as pet and watchdog.\n",
      "Hello there, I'm helping my friend here for those with good hearts to adopt her cats. Here are the details from her post: (URGENT!) Here I have one mother cat and her four kittens in need of a new loving home. Reasons to let go; (i) Little brother has an allergic reaction to cats and (ii) I, myself, am still studying so I could not afford to take care of them at the moment. Please be kind enough to give these babies a home. I am very sure that they'll be wonderful companions for life, the mother has been vaccinated and dewormed but not for the kids. Details: The mother is a strong three-legged cat born on the 15th of August and the kittens was born on the 1st of May . In the picture, Top left: Piglet (Male) Bottom left: Nobu (Male) Middle: Tofu, the mother. Top right: Asuka (Female) Bottom right: Igloo (Female) If you're up for adoption, send me a Whatsapp at (Julia) Location: KL/Shah Alam. OR (Hanafi) Location: Seremban, NS.\n",
      "** No - we're not regular white haired cats with blue eyes (even if our uniqueness won't capture in our pics below)! We are full Albino twins and our genes account for only 2% of the cat population. We have special pink glints in our eyes and yes, like all other Albino animals out there we'll do wonderful in a fully indoor environment (not too much time under the direct sun). Please read on for more details about us! :) ** ------------------------------------------------------------- Introducing handsome little Demetrius! ♥ Male kitten, 4 1/2 months old. Brother to Florentino (Profile: ) ♥ A softie, Demetri has his moments of interest in play but mostly prefers a good cuddle and climbing over laps (he can fall asleep barely seconds after cuddling!). He has the loudest purr too. ♥ Demetri loves people and is easy with other cats (he will adjust fast as long as they're not aggressive towards him) - he will also be the first to explore any new environment or say hello to our vets / visitors. ♥ Demetri will do wonderful in a home where he'll receive lots of petting and affection. He's gentle when he plays and never uses his claws - hence mature children or even babies will make wonderful sidekicks! ♥ Demetri is on the road to recovery from a mild case of flu and is otherwise healthy. He has been dewormed, deflead and is very clever with the litter box. Prefers wet food over dry (although not a picky eater). ***PLEASE READ (Note for adopters)***: ○ Demetri must be kept % indoors for his own safety. Apartments need to be cat-safe. ○ Premium food feeding only (no Whiskas, Friskies etc). Please inquire to know more, this is for any cats long term welfare. Please drop me an email or call if you feel that you may be just the right person to give this boy a loving home. Thank you!\n",

      "This little angel is really cute! 👼 She's always super excited to see me and very playful. Then I realized that she's only a few months old and constantly surrounded by other males - not a good thing! There are already thousands of un-homed strays and we don't need them to keep breeding and giving birth to puppies. So I decided to take her for neutering and vaccination. The operation was a success and she's all happy again! She's young, VERY friendly, active (but won't go crazy on you), and smart (she sat in my car quietly for 30 mins but only when we arrived, she jumped out to poop). You will make her even more happier than she already is if you can give her a home 🏡 If you can't adopt, then share this with friends who are looking to get a dog. Oh btw, I'm calling her Bubbles coz she's really bubbly and friendly but she's not used to this name yet so you can always change it when you adopt her! :)\n",

      "Husky was rescued and fostered by me at the moment. He is looking for a good home and family that can love and treat him as part of the family. Husky Boy is still young and need love, patients and attention, so must take care him well. He is very alert and will guard your house faithfully in return for tender loving care (however if you're purely looking for a guard dog who you can tie in your porch all day long to take care of your house, Husky is not for you). He is cute and healthy, playful and very good with humans and other dogs. As he is used to being indoors and loves being around with people and having company. However, if you do have a big compound for him to run and play, he will love it too because he was very active. Terms and conditions for adoption are: 1)MUST be sprayed/neutered (Cost will be considered if sharing required) 2)MUST continue with his annual vaccinations. 3)Only suitable for landed properties as Husky needed a landed property with big compound to move around. 4)MUST NOT be caged or chained for long periods of time. 5)MUST be provided with sufficient shelter from sun and rain. 6)Must have proper food and water for him (No bones allowed) 7)MUST walked him every morning and evening. 8)Must be able to afford veterinary care if he falls ill. 9)Must upkeep monthly tick treatment and Heartgard prevention to prevent tick fever and heartworms (also to prevent tick infestation in your home and transmission of ticks to your family). 10)Not suitable for factory, workshop or farm use. 11)During the stage of adoption, do allow home visit or, email picture or sent what's app picture, so that as a rescuer, I can ensure that Husky Boy is adjustable well to his new environment with his new loving family in his forever home. If you can fulfill the above conditions then you are a suitable and caring adopter for Husky Boy. Please contact me at for more info of the above adoption. “Only serious adopters who can look after Husky Boy himself/herself will be entertained” because as a rescuer, I definitely don’t tolerate ‘Animal Cruelty’ Thank you for your kind consideration and understanding to the above terms and conditions.\n",

      "Blue the miniature Poodle was found abandoned on the street in early November . He was suffering from skin problem (yeast infection). He was treated at the vet and has recovered from yeast infection. He used to scratch and chew himself until he is injured. He still requires continuous monitoring and treatment for his hind legs as he may have met an accident before we foster him and he is currently undergoing holistic treatment. He is allergic to certain food, hence, he has limited choices in food but he can take certain kibble. He is friendly with humans and dogs, except when he thinks the human is trying to apply antiseptic cream on him when he was injured back then. He growled and snapped as he was in pain. Hence, it is best that he does not go to a home with very young children as they may accidentally harm him and he would snap. He is toilet trained and stays indoor. He hardly barks. If you are ready to adopt him as part of your family, please send us a message to describe the following: 1. Your experience handling dogs 2. The environment you intend to provide him with 3. Are you agreeable to house visit in the future and to send us regular updates Please note that we do not entertain comments asking us to call you back. Please send us a message instead.

      "Nice little fella which owner have left the country due to personal urgency. I decided to take him up and put him up for adoption because i cant just leave him be and to be frank, i cant keep him (Just had a new born) So i cant keep him for long. Trained for potty (only pees when you walk him or let him out from house) - unless u dont let him out at all, then accidents do happen. Had an eye flap operation years ago due to unattended eye ulcer by his previous owner but he is fine now. Very alert. Good companion. Sticks to you when there is loud thunder like a little boy. Does not bark. Loves to play fetch. No caging, no tying up for long, must give lots of love. I welcome responsible and genuine adopters. You can drop me a message through Whatsapp and maybe let me know what is your experience with dog and we take it from there . My number\n",
      "Jimmy, Jack and Joe are three adorable little boy kittens. They are very clean, very healthy and very playful. They are used to other cats and our dog. They are litter trained. Jimmy and Jack are bob-tail cats, Joey has a tail. It would be nice if they could stay together but they can be adopted separately. Please get in touch if you can offer Jimmy, Jack and Joe a 'forever' home.\n",
      "This is Jasper.I have had him for almost 3 years now. The reason I am giving him up for adoption is because the place I live in is very unsuitable for him. There are too many stray cats in my area and Jasper has come home too many times after being involved in serious cat fights. I have had to take him to the vet hospital so many times as an emergency case because of his fighting. I tried to keep him indoors and not letting him go out, but he got very depressed and wasn't interested in anything anymore. He loves to go out and sit in the sun and to roll in the grass. However, where I live, the place is very dangerous and there are hardly any fields for him to run and play at. I am looking for someone who seriously loves and understands cats. It is very important that the area you live in should have a field/park as close to the house as possible, or hopefully, your housing area is safe and clean. He needs to go out into the field and play, otherwise he gets very cranky if you only lock him indoors. Jasper is a very loving cat, very chubby and fat. He's almost 6 kg. He loves people and loves to be petted. Also, he's a vegetarian. He only eats cat biscuits, nothing else. Not chicken, fish, prawn, etc. He's also trained to use the cat litter. But he has a weak immune system, and he's prone to getting a flu often. So if you are interested in Jasper, you also need to know that he needs a booster every week. It's a small bottle (about RM49) and it can last a few months. You only need to put 7ml of it in his mouth once a week, so that Jasper doesn't get the flu. I am only looking for serious adopters who will take very good care of Jasper and will love him very, very much. He's a very special and a beautiful cat. If you are interested, please email me at or you can send me a FB message at\n",

      "Flan and her siblings were rescued from an unfriendly house that they were hanging out at. We managed to the mom(spayed and released) but now the kitties need to find a good family. They’re about 3 ½ months old, and have been dewormed, de-ticked and will have their first vaccination soon. All three of them are not big fans of my rescue dog, Bobo, will scowl or hiss at her when she comes too near, otherwise, i think they all just tolerate dogs. Flan Flan is the only female of the three kittens. We think that she’ll grow up to look like her very pretty mum, who has similar markings and color, but only darker. She has a kink at the beginning of her tail, we’re not sure how she got it, but she can look quite funny especially when she’s alert or playing. Am looking for a good family who will spay her and care for her. Please watsapp me at or email me at if you are interested. Thanks!\n",

      "Many thanks to Miss Jasmine from Penang to adopt COCO and promising to give her a new sweet home! I picked up Coco from SPCA 2 weeks after I got another dog Fifi. I'm not very familiar with type of breed as I'm no expert, but according to the SPCA guys, she is a Labrador mix. 5 months, she grew rapidly. She's a bit heavier compared to my other dog and she has strong thigh. She's a loving puppy and most of the times will be playing on her own. She is toilet trained, poo only outside the house and pee only in toilet. She loves to ride in car with air blowing to her face. Coco feds only on Purina Dried Food and canned food on weekends. Unfortunately, Coco is now alone at home as Fifi has been adopted by a new good owner with someone to accompany her all the time. I hope to find a good owner for Coco as well as I love both of them. Reason for me to let go is due to my career which requires me to travel very often now. I have no choice but to let her go with a heavy heart.

Thank you VERY VERY MUCH in advance for reading this listing and forwarding it to your friends and family. Apologies in advance if the Terms and Conditions set out below are a little \"harsh\", but I have gotten too many calls/ responses from very rude people, calls from people who do not even know that it is NOT OK to call people at 2am, etc. Also, our intentions are very simple: WE JUST WANT TO FIND GOOD HOMES FOR THE PUPPIES. ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- TERMS AND CONDITIONS:- (1) Please DO NOT ask me what breed these are, they are stray puppies.

(5) We reside in Seri Kembangan, KL, near the Astro office (there is someone at home 95% of the time). Please only contact us if you are willing to come to our house to pick the puppies up.

(7) If you and your family members are interested to adopt, please get agreement from all members before contacting us.

You can pass us the money when you pick up the puppy. We will donate on your behalf and mail you the receipt in your name.

HOW COULD ANY HUMAN DO THIS! its unforgiveable! the poor baby is ready to go home. i gave him the heartgaurd to deworm him...and i want the new owner to take him for vacination. i didnt vaccinate him cuz i am afraid what if he is already vaccinated. it doesn't look like a stray dog ofcourse. looks alike poodle a lot cuz of his hair. the only problem is with his leg..it was tied up for several hours which is why he can't walk properly. he is perfectly healthy. he is eating normally but is kind of scared. i would love to keep him at my apartment but sadly i cant cuz its a LARGE POODLE mix. (his paws are big) and i already have 3 dogs at home. i would have kept if he is small breed but i can't cuz the management is very strickt here. please if you are interested kindly call me on. No sms, only call. thanx. (you can come to see puppy anytime)\n",

      "We found this amazing little guy abandoned in the streets of Mont Kiara at about 4 weeks old, alone and injured. We brought him home to nurse him back to health and found that he was the sweetest, most loving, kind and playful kitten ever (and i've had quite a few kittens in my life). Now at 6 weeks he is fully recovered and in NEED of a home as we will shortly be leaving the country. I can't stress enough how sad i am to part with this amazing cat and what a perfect pet he will be. If it was up to me I would most certainly keep him. We were looking at shelters to drop him to but i would feel much better placing him directly with a new owner. The most important thing to us is to find him an equally loving family to take him in. He is a tiny little guy. Pale golden cream tabby with white paws and belly. Right now his eyes are blue but they will probably develop as he matures. He is fully potty trained and is on a diet of baby cat food mixed with warm water (to soften it). Personality wise, he is very adaptable. We pulled him off the streets scared and untrained and within a day he figured out the cat box. Within two days he was coming over to sit on our laps and cuddle! As with most kittens his age he is playful but tends to entertain himself. He LOVES pets and will spend hours with you purring away with any attention you give him. Please contact me if you are at all interested. Time is of the essence! we will be leaving in less than two weeks! I'm happy to send more pictures/videos and even set up a time for you to meet him.\n",

      "Buster is still waiting for his forever home... could you be the one for Buster? /14 UPDATE: Buster has been neutered and is ready to go to his forever home. Please call us if you can give Buster the home that he deserves! ******************** We found Buster last Sunday (13/4/14) in Bukit Indah, Ampang. He was clearly lost, and was frightened and confused. After spending ages trying to calm him down, we managed to get him home. Unfortunately he did not get along with one of our foster dogs at all. So we had to board him at our vet while we tried to locate his family. We have had no luck so far as no one has come forward to claim him although his picture has been shared alot and we have also put up posters in the area where we found him and in the surrounding tamans. He has however, been miserable at the vet and has refused food since Sunday. He has also been howling and trashing himself against the cage, trying to get out. We managed to get another foster carer today (/14) and he is feeling much better at the foster carer's place. We have discovered that he's okay with female dogs and puppies :) but dislikes adult male dogs. Buster is a really sweet dog and loves to sit and cuddle in your lap. He loves car rides too and would sit in your lap and look out the window quite happily. Buster needs to be in a home environment with someone who will give him lots of cuddles and love. Do you think you can give Buster the home he deserves? Please call me at .\n",

      "STILL LOOKING FOR A GOOD HOME FOR ADOPTION: Serious enquirers only ( Experienced dog owners preferred) within the Klang valley. Message from Ex-foster mummy: With a heavy heart I must find her a good home where she is allowed to be dog and be happy. She has been through a lot, I only wish the best for her. Will care for her till she get a home. Terms and Condition: There will be an Adoption fee, PM me and we'll go through a interview process, if successful home visit must be allowed before handing over the dog. Bi-monthly home visit to check up on the dog. Health status: Mild Hip Dysplasia, other than that overall healthy spayed, vaccinated. Location: currently in Ipoh (grandma's house) Summary: I’m Freya Tumbleweed a 7 year old Belgian Shepherd Malinois. I was previously a skinny 13kgs, malnourished abandoned dog found on the streets in Klang until a kind hearted Samaritan found me and posted up about me on Facebook requesting for help. Foster mummy’s friend responded and took me to a vet and a couple of days I was handed over to my foster mummy. I was diagnosed with HeartWorm thankfully it was only Stage 1, I was put on a safer treatment a combination of Doxycycline and HeartGard (Ivermectin) for 6 months. I stayed in foster mummy’s care for close to a year, making sure I was totally recovered and was then send for spaying, I was suspected to be used for breeding. I couldn’t stay too long at foster mummy’s house mainly it was because I couldn’t get along with 2 out of 4 dogs that live there and I had to stay indoors leashed because of foster mummy’s cats safety ( I still had my daily twice a day walks though) and foster mummy and family felt bad for me. On the 11th of November I was send to my foster mummy’s ( now ex-foster mummy) grandma’s house which is 2 hours away since they were looking for another dog to help watch over the house. I managed to adapt myself to my new environment pretty quick. Unfortunately on the 14th of December, I managed to escape the backyard fence through a hole I managed to find and escape to find my friend ( nobody was at home except Grandma). Grandma spotted me and wanted to bring me back, I got a little overzealous over grandma trying to leash me I accidentally caused my grandma to fall (she is in recovery but slow). Grandma now prefers I go back with Ex-foster mummy and other family agree for the sake of her safety. Ex-foster mummy says I’m overall a good/watch dog but I get overzealous at times and I like to jump hug people that is kind of a problem. Long story short Ex-foster mummy is now looking at finding me a new home that has a nice size compound and family that will give me the LOVE/ATTENTION/DISCIPLINE/EXERCISE I need. I get on well in general with other dogs provided they are nice and friendly; I DON’T do well with AGGRESSIVE/CRAZY/DOMINANT DOGS. I will definitely love my humans maybe a tad bit too much, I get along with children (preferably 10 years old and above). I have mild Hip Dysplasia, I will need to take Glucosamine daily. I have thunder/fireworks Phobia! kindly contact me through facebook PM\n",

We were planning to keep her at my friend's house but without any warning, she gave birth to 6 puppies on 16th January . We would like to keep the mummy as she and the 2 doggies in my friend's house are very attached. Out of 6, 2 puppies passed away due to the heat. 2 have been adopted and another 2 is looking for a home. However, the 2 doggies are not welcoming the new additions and we are planning to send the mummy for spaying as soon as the 3 months period of weaning & whelping is over. The 3 months whelping period is soon going to be over. So, would like to inquire if anyone would like to adopt the puppies in 15 days time. Ps. We would prefer people who spay the puppies when they reach 3 months. Pss. Would prefer people who allow us visitation rights as we want to ensure the puppies are taken care off.\n",

      "Hi, my cat has 3 kittens up for adoption. I am unable to take care of so many cats as I'm always out of house due to work so I'm looking for kind, caring people to take care of them and want to have their own cats as pets as soon as possible. The 2nd one is Duzell, the only female of the bunch. She's very playful and loves to follow you around once she gets close to you. Her colour is not too black and has a hint of gray. She has a pair of 'white stockings' on her back legs which makes her look even cuter. They are able to eat wet and dried food. But for now, mostly wet food and slowly introduce them to dried ones. Duzell can already use the litter box like her brothers, so she is toilet trained and won't make too much mess. If interested in one, or more of them, please call/sms me at or email me. Unfortunately I don't have whatsapp, but if you need any additional pictures to be sent, please let me know your emails and I'll send them over.\n",

I had to coax her out because she was frightened by SPain's barking. Somehow, she traveled from my back lane to the front and knew where my house is despite never being out before. It's a miracle for me! Caty escaped through an open window into my back lane between the night of Friday, 25 May and the morning of Saturday, 26 May in Taman Tun Dr Ismail, KL. She is very easily recognisable as: 1) she's missing a left eye, 2) her right ear is v-notched and 3) she's wearing a purple collar and bell.\n",

      "Hello everybody! My name is Winnie. My rescuers named me that because I look like a bear! So Winnie the Pooh was the inspiration for my name. Just like Mr.Pooh, I'm adventurous and very loving! I can't stop wagging my tail when i hear my name being called! Can I be your furever friend? _______________________________ Back story, we feed a bunch of strays in our area and did not manage to get one of the female dogs to be spayed in time so out pop-ed 5 little angles. We are still struggling to get our older foster dogs adopted so we thought it would be okay to leave this family where they were. But the weather was very unkind and it rained during most of the night. As a result, this furry family ended up not having a warm place to sleep at night so we decided to take them in, give them whatever we can. Unfornutely, 2 of the puppies did not make it. RIP. However, we have 3 very strong and bright puppies up for adoption, Winnie, Oreo and Minnie! They were born on June 29th (which makes them a month old today!)

      "The kitten is tri-coloured and semi-Persian. She's about 3 weeks old which is why we haven't spayed her. If you want her spayed, you can adopt her and when she's old enough we'll bring her to the vet to be spayed. My friend found her in the garbage and took her to the vet. I fostered her and now she is currently being fostered by my cousin. She's very small and playful. her bites aren't painful (to me). Scratches just feel like feathers falling on you. She's currently being fed soft food and milk. She has already been taken to the vet and taken her medicine but we will take her to the vet on the 12th of June again to be absolutely sure she is worm-free. I don't know for how long my cousin can keep her :/ hoping to find a loving owner for her as soon as possible. If interested, you can contact me or Nicole (rescuer) at :) P.S. she is extremely cute.\n",

He knows what you're thinking and loves to understand you more. He loves to sleep on your lap when you're on the computer. He also know how to poo in the litter box because I've trained it already.

      "Mini Cino and 8 super cute pups are discovered at this garden at Jalan SS 23 / 6, Petaling Jaya. The pups were recently delivered in a hole at the park's collapsed stairway (see photo), and they are now very cute and active, bouncing around and playing, usually early in the morning before 10am and in the evenings. The pups' friendly mom is sometimes hanging around, and she seems fine with people playing or touching her pups. The pups enjoy attention and will try to lick your hand too. I believe Mini Cino is the cute pups' \"aunty\", and usually hangs around with the pups' mum, a black dog of similar size. A few of the pups seem to be suffering from some mild skin infection, though nothing that a quick visit to the vet can't resolve. Hopefully someone can adopt these cute pups, their mom or aunty, so they won't be suffering on the streets. For those interested, please visit the place directly during mornings or evenings, the pups should be hanging out around the garden or inside the hole.\n",

      "This cutie pie was found in the middle of LDP highway, curled up into a tiny ball. He was extremely lucky as I had recently seen a dog get caught on that same shoulder but it managed to get off the highway. I thought to myself how sad it wold be if another animal got stuck there. Just then, I looked out my car window saw a tiny ball of fur the size of a tennis ball. He looked up for a quick second and I saw his eyes wide open in fear. I had to do something about it. I managed to catch him and took him home with me. Since then, he's been vaccinated, dewormed and kept indoors with us. He's very playful, but not destructive and is very friendly with other pets (dogs and cats). Very loving and independent, and is very easy to please. He purrs the moment you touch him and looks at you with the most loving eyes in the world! Can someone please come and give him a good home? I can do spaying and neutering if the adopter is willing to share with the costs.\n",

She is not picky about pet food but can get addicted to low-quality kitten kibble (whiskas, purina etc.) but it's mostly due to additives in the food. She is smart and can be curious at times.

      "Introducing gorgeous little Tequila! ♥ Female kitten, 5 1/2 months old. Has a diluted-tortie coat with gorgeous green eyes. ♥ Tequila is full of character! She's a vibrant little girl who loves to dash about and play. She is both a little darling as well as mischievous (when no ones looking)! ♥ Tequila has her own unique way of displaying affection. Tortoiseshell cats are known for abundance of character and this lady is no different (Read here:). ♥ Sometimes she purrs - sometimes she has a lot to say (yes she talks  meows back). Sometimes she forces herself onto our laps for strokes - and at other times she plants a loving nip or two. ♥ She gets along great with cats her age and kittens. Is weary of bigger adult cats and only approaches if they're friendly (not growling or hissing). Otherwise she takes some time to adjust. ♥ Tequila is great with people although we would recommend that only adults or people adjusted to tortie behavior adopt her (as her nippings might not be tolerable for children). ♥ This girl is very clever with her little-box and eats her kibble without complaint. She has been vaccinated, dewormed and given spot-on prevention against fleas and other parasites. ***[IMPORTANT] Note for potential adopters*** ○ Tequila must be kept INDOORS at all times (for her own safety). ○ Tequila must be SPAYED at the right age. ○ Premium food feeding only (no Whiskas, Friskies etc). Please inquire, this is for her long-term well being. Drop me an email or call if you feel that you may be just the right person for this girl. Thank you!\n",

My current fosterers managed to give away 5 of my siblings to loving families and are planning to keep my mum and my sister. My neighbours are not too happy with us being around and they’ve called the council a few times to take us away. So me and my other 2 sisters need to be re-homed soon as we are growing older as well. I can walk on leash but don’t quite like car rides. I don’t do ‘my business’ everywhere but on the grass or designated areas by my owners only. For now, I can sit before eating but I am easily trainable to do tricks or potty training. Pweese take me with you and shower me your love.. I’m waiting positively. \n",

      "Hi, I have another adult female cat who had babies. They're all about 6 weeks old now so they should be able to be given away. This would probably be my last batch of kittens since I would finally want to spay my cat after this. I would like to keep them, but my current circumstances does allow me to so I'm hoping to find interested pet lovers. This one is called Pepa or Pepper, another spice name. She's pretty chill kitten, doesn't run around much, but is pretty friendly and likes to play with her 'twin', Orey. The difference between her and Orey is she has brownish color on her legs. Orey can already eat wet food and a bit of dried food, so food wise, it shouldn't be too much of a problem. If you can, maybe get one pack of kitten milk and feed her that until it finishes. I'm currently training her and her siblings to use the litter box and it seems that they know where to do their business now so that's good. If interested in one, or more of them, please call/sms me at or email me. Unfortunately I don't have whatsapp, but if you need any additional pictures to be sent, please let me know your emails and I'll send them over.\n",

You can also help us to find a forever loving home for this sweetheart by clicking the SHARE button and share it with your friends or family that are interested in adopting him. Much appreciated. ------------------------------------ His story : Was rushing to an appointment and saw this lil one hiding under a red car at an area that we are familiar with. Got a friend to check him out while I rush to my appointment and he was not found. After 9 hours, passed by again and saw him at the exact same spot waiting. Once I stopped my car, he came towards me wagging his tail. I'm VERY sure this is a dumping case, because there is no strays around or pregnant female dogs at the nearest strays area. This is what humans are capable of. He is probably just 4 months old, don't even know what is going on or how to fend for himself. He has got dandruff all over his top fur. And he looks so hungry. We named him Leshem, meaning precious. Because life is precious no matter in which form. He has been treated at the vet, showered, dewormed and vaccinated. He is back home with us now while waiting for a forever home he can count on as family. This is a result of irresponsible ownership, attitudes of just buying a pet, not neutering and then running away from responsibility. These are lives, not a bag you can just dump aside as you wish. Be responsible, be a human with a heart. Adopt, don't buy or shop. Neuter your pets.\n",

Rm is imposed as a safe deposit which will be deducted from the neutering fee or returned to the owner if the owner neuters Mr Butterfly within 12 months. Neutering is important: - To prevent your pet from contributing to homeless animals that are starved, abused and often killed - Increase the health and temperament of your pet - To reduce urine spraying around the house, frequencies of running out of the house (which may render your pet vulnerable to dog bites, cat fights, hit by car, poisoning, abused by strangers, infectious diseases), making lots of annoying noises during mating seasons.\n",
      "Affectionately known as Timmy boy / Little Bear / Timmy Bear, Tim was reported to us by a kind mamak owner who fed him at USJ 1. Contracted with serious TVT disease, Tim's plight was highlighted on Facebook groups repeatedly and yet no one went to his rescue. His penis was the size of a tennis ball when we rescued him, and guess what? He was already spayed before! Now that he's free from TVT, gentle giant Tim really needs a home that he can belong to. Don't be intimidated by his size! Very huggable of course (about kg), and can definitely coexist with other dogs. He will avoid eye contact if dogs are looking for a fight with him (despite being able to give them a good slap, of course). When going out for strolls, he walks not in front, not behind, but with you :) Please open up your heart to Timmy boy! Liz: Kin:\n",
      "My friend rescued this kitten from being run down in the middle of the road among the workshop zone last Saturday in Bandar Sunway. Now the kitten is up for adoption as we dont have the capacity to take care of it and we don't really want to send it to a shelter because we know for sure a kitten at that age will not survive the shelter condition. Yet we dont have the space to keep a kitten of this age. We are suspecting the kitten to be a female about 3 weeks old. Obviously no medical record but the kitten appears to look healthy. We have been feeding it dry kitten kibbles soak in milk at home. It's still quite fiece but we suspect its due to the poor eye sight (due to young age). But once you hold the fella and stroke her, she will calm down. Of course situation doesnt really help also since we have another cat that kept hissing at her everytime she meows. We will not be charging if someone is able to provide her a home. Please contact me, Stephani at for details.\n",

      "We found her when she was almost on the verge of death, with her lower jaw fractured in 2 places. We had her undergo a surgery, and now she is on the road to recovery. She has been vaccinated, and all her surgery costs paid for. As she grows into a beautiful cat, her jaw will heal back to normal, and according to the vet, she will be able to eat normally. As of now, no medication is needed anymore, just letting healing takes place. As she recovers, she needs your TLC. And she is no different from any other cute kitten. Very gentle and sweet in nature, all she needs is your TLC. Please kindly consider to adopt her, or please foster her until a suitable adopter comes along.

      "This handsome fluffy guy walked into a food stall and was very friendly and very hunger. We decided to bring him to our office and get him used to people, which wasn't a problem at all. And to litter train him,which was every easy to do as long as the litter box is cleaned at least twice a day. He really doesn't like a dirty litter box He enjoys exploring and doing his \"rounds\" around the office and play outdoors (done under strict supervision), once he is done with that he just likes to chill out and look good and handsome. He is very mellow and will follow you everywhere just like your shadow. He loves being around people and being given lots loving attention. He also loves to chat and is fairly vocal which, we believe, is due to Morrison having either Siamese or Burmese blood in him. If you want a quiet or silent cat Morrison isn't right for you. The adopter should have a home with an enclosed yard which is cat proofed as Morrison does enjoy a little romp around the yard and, if given the chance the neighbourhood. Safety is very important so that Morrison can give his love to his guardian. Morrison may be an \"older\" cat but trust me he has a wonderful personality and will make a great and loving companion to anyones home. Do watch the video to see Morrison enjoying the yard and basking in being petted and given the love and attention he deserves. If you can't see the video on the mobile app, please visit If you are interested in adopting Morrison please call, sms or whatsapp to James (English only) at or Justin (English and Bahasa) at\n",

      "Hey everyone! So my friends and I were walking around some shop lots earlier this evening and we heard loud meowing coming from a box. To our not-so-surprise, we found a little kitty that some irresponsible nitwit had abandoned infront of phone store. The kitty is being fostered and taken good care of by a friend of mine right now, we are actually really concerned for the little one as she is only 1 week old. And yes, it's a SHE. As for now, she's weak on her limbs since she is only a week old and is without the presence of her mother. She has pretty blue eyes, in fact, that is one of the main features we noticed when we picked her up. ADOPTION IS ONLY FOR RESIDENTS IN THE PETALING JAYA/ KUALA LUMPUR AREA. WE ARE NOT ABLE TO DELIVER THE KITTEN TO ANY ADOPTERS, ADOPTION IS BY MEANS OF COLLECTION ONLY. CONDITIONS UPON ADOPTION: 1) The kitten will need to be fully taken care of because of it's dyer need of care at only 2 weeks old. 2) The kitten is to be kept INDOORS at ALL TIMES. (We do not want another case of a homeless kitten.) 3) If you were to adopt this kitten, do expect calls from us from time to time to keep up on her condition as she is still a precious fragile baby that we have been fostering. 4) If Karma cannot adapt to her surroundings, Karma needs to be re-homed as it is only in a kittens nature to find comfort in where they wish to in the absence of the parent cat, and we wished to respect that. 5) Once Karma reaches the age of 1 year, Karma will need to be neutered and vaccinated to avoid further irresponsible abandoning of kittens. 6) We will not allow Karma to be caged, kittens (at least) need to be placed in a comfy kitten litter or a box layered with towels as they are in need of warmth, without warmth, fatality is at hand. 7) Karma is still weak on her limbs, she will require kitten milk, preferably without lactose. 8) Allow Karma to walk for bout 15 minutes a day under supervision to strengthen her limbs. We understand that there might be many terms and conditions, but we want the best for her.\n",

      "'Jetta' is a cute 7-8 month female 'Malaysian Pedigree' (Muttley) Puppy who is looking for her forever family. She loves people and isn't hyperactive so would suit any family of any age. She's also good with cats and other dogs. She has been 'frontlined'; dewormed and has had her first vaccination. I will personally pay for the remainder of her initial vaccinations and for her to be neutered when old enough. She is completely black, except for a white spot on her chest and a few white hairs on her feet. We think she's going to be a medium to large sized dog as she's already a good size. Fingers crossed she finds her forever home soon :)\n",

      "These kittens are probably only a day or two old and they have nowhere to go. A friend of mine found them when the mummy cat (top picture) gave birth in his dad's shop but he is allergic to cats and has no means to care of them but the shop lots are not really a safe place for newborn kittens to live. His last resort is to abandon them in a random housing area! I need the help of any kind-hearted man, woman, girl or boy out there who would be kind enough to look after these darlings until they are old enough to be separated from their mum and be given to good homes or if lucky, a home where they can be together. Please help! I need to save these poor babies from the cold streets ):! I already have 5 cats at home and am a full-time college student. I would be more than willing to take care of them if I had the time and space but I do not... Anyone interested...?\n",

Much appreciated. --------------------------------------------- Her story : 25th May As we returned home from work, as we pass through Puchong we saw a cage left outside the old veterinary clinic of St Angels Puchong. There it was a Cairn Terrier alike and her 6 puppies. Very highly possibly a dumping case from a backyard breeder. Her puppies looks like just a few days old. Trapped in a small rusty cat cage, matted hair, smelling horrible and poo all around the cage. If we leave them there, they will have no chance at all. So home they went with us. When we arrived home, it was further proven that she once had an owner, is trained and is used for breeding. She walks on leash like a trained dog and knows exactly what to do. Initially, she was a little fierce as she must have been in so much fear. After some time, she calmed down a little more. Marnie has got very badly matted hair all over her and very bad tick infestation. Showered and shaved off all her fur. Due to her being around her puppies we do not dare to use too strong of a tick shampoo on her, hence more on manually removing them slowly. She is around 6 years old, puppies are not more than 2 days old. Her legs appears to be very weak, doctor says she is being caged all the time type. So it's most probably used for breeding before this. G3 is one of Marnie's puppies. This is a result of irresponsible ownership, attitudes of just buying a pet, not neutering and then running away from responsibility. These are lives, not a bag you can just dump aside as you wish. Be responsible, be a human with a heart. Adopt, don't buy or shop. Neuter your pets.\n",
      "Eddy was adopted when he was 3 months and neglected by the adopter, i took him back when i found out. Nurtured Eddy back to health and he was adopted a second time by another but they had many other pets and were not able to give Eddy the attention he needed so he kept running away. Eddy needs someone who will love and care for him. Eddy needs someone who can pay individual attention to him. Eddy needs someone will be patient with him.\n",

      "This lovely feline family was rescued by my friend Eileen on Monday, November . She was walking along enjoying the weather when she came across the heartwarming sight of two little kittens snoozing on some porch steps.. Their mother stood watch nearby. At first she eyed Eileen suspiciously but then decided that she liked her. As a gesture of her desire for friendship, she immediately meowed at Eileen and demanded to be fed and petted. She also allowed Eileen to handle her kittens. That was the start of a beautiful friendship and suddenly Eileen had three kittycats on her hands.. Sweet Pea is the mama cat. She has a unique beautiful tortoiseshell coat and large, round, green eyes. She is very affectionate and sweet, a loving mother and would be a great companion for any cat lover. She's about 3 years old and received her first vaccination on December 6, . Dora is the adventurous rascal of the family. She's a marmalade tabby with bright blue eyes. She loves exploring and isn't scared of new people and places. She's always the first one to check things out. Sidney is a little shyer than his extraverted sister. He has green eyes and sleek black fur. He loves wrestling and tumbling around with his sister.. He's also mummy's boy and sticks to Sweet Pea. Once he gets to know you, he is a playful and manja little furball. For adoption to a safe and loving home. Preferably INDOOR. Vaccinations and neutering at 6 months are COMPULSORY. NO CAGE CONFINEMENT please unless during instances of illness or injury. Interested parties can call, sms, or email me. Serious inquiries only please. A description of yourself and your experience with cats is greatly appreciated. Adoption procedure: - Set up a meeting with me and the cats. - See if potential adopter and cats are suitable for each other. - Succesful adopter will then have to meet us at the vet in order to get kitty vaccinated before being able to take kitty home. Cost of vaccination to be borne by adopter.\n",

His blood tests results are fine, with no major problems. He is a very handsome dog too! He has a hilarious goofy face when he sticks his tongue out. He loves giving big hugs and loves being pet. Doctors suggest that he is suitable for families with kids because of his very good nature. He is currently not neutered yet, as his wound is still healing. It would take about a week for his wound to fully heal, and then he'd be able to undergo castration. We are looking for a warm, loving home for gentle Tuesday. :)\n",

      "Playful and active kittens for adoption. Found one of the kitten at burger stall near my house. Rest of the kitten showed up in front of my house on the next day. We can't keep the kittens as we stay in small apartment. Please SMS and PM me if interested\n",
      "she is a loving and friendly pet....she is more of a protective dog\n",
      "She's sweet and easy to warm up to pup. Active and likes to engage in play, but is reserved to start. She bonds very well with adults and children alike, and is more likely to bond one-on-one than in groups. Jo tends to be more on the timid side, but once she is familiar with someone (which does not take long), she adapts very well with the environment. She is still very young, so her personality may change. Thus far Jo's settled in well to her foster homes, where she gets along with other pups and animals in the home. Josephine is still very young, thus needs a lot of attention. She does not like being left alone and does tend to follow you around or yelp quite a bit when left on her own, which can be a problem at night. She should grow out of this phase soon, and although it's a difficult phase, this is the best time to bond and form a solid attachment with her. We would love to keep Josephine but our apartment does not allow for pets, and it is far too small a space for her size. She has gotten dewormed and done one wash for fleas and ticks, with other vaccinations and a neutering pending with vets advice, as they suggest we wait for her to get a little older.\n",
      "Introducing adorable Katya! ♥ Female kitten, 5 weeks old, medium-haired ticked tabby with hazel eyes. ♥ An adventurous girl, Katya enjoys exploring her surroundings and is constantly on the lookout for chances to have fun! She is inquisitive of new people, cats and even dogs. She has quite the purr when it's cuddle-time, too! A very independent girl for her young age. :) ♥ Has been de-wormed (once) and given flea medication (Frontline). Katya is still too young to be vaccinated. ♥ Able to eat independently (Royal Canin BabyCat kibbles) and is already clever with the litter-box. ***PLEASE READ (Note for adopters)***: - Katya must be kept INDOORS at all times (to avoid unwanted accidents). - Adopters must NEUTER her at the right age. - Must be fed premium food (no Whiskas, Friskies kibbles etc), this is for her long-term welfare. Please drop me an email or call if you feel that you may be just the right person for this girl. Thank you! :)\n",
      "We found this dog wandering outside our house and was going to cross the road. So we rescued it and temporarily sheltering him while nursing his starvation and injuries. Sent him to the vet and found that he was neutered. Most probbably dewormed and vaccinated if he is neutered. Not sure. Injuries on face and ear from dog fights but the vet gave us the medicine for him. Excellent temperament with humans. Happy go lucky and independent. Extremely inactive (maybe not feeling well) but limited attention necessary. Good companion and always looking for some love from people. We would love to keep him but my other male dog hates him and my neighbour hates all of us especially our dog(s).\n",

      "We live in KL and are looking for some advice to find a new loving home for our Dog, Wagyu a 3 year old Shiba Inu pure breed. My wife is giving birth to our first child in January and the reason we want to find a new home is that we do not want a dog around a small baby. Based on looks … for sure he is the number 1 in the world But overall he is more of a wild animal than a Lab / Beagle etc … and as a result we always need to treat him with respect / care. He needs a garden / space to run around in. We read a lot about the breed before we bought him. Everything that is on the internet about the breed (Shiba Inu) is % true. Their character, how they act, that they need to be on a leash … everything. We have had him fixed, so this calmed him down a lot. He is a healthy dog, been well looked after and in good health with a full passport / vaccinations etc. If you have anyone that would like to meet Wagyu, let us know and we can arrange any time. Above all else, we want to know that he has gone to a family that will love him as much as we have. It is a very hard decision to put Wagyu up for adoption. Thank you, Scott Photos of Wagyu\n",

      "Mac was found with a collar around shops at Ara Damansara. We can't find his owner, hence he is up for adoption. Extremely good natured dog. Not yappy at all but very alert and will bark at any strangers approaching. Toilet trained, will do his business during walks, so twice daily walks are needed. He doesn't dirty the house, doesn't dig or chew. Very independent and steady. Happy to stay on his own but he also seems friendly with other dogs. You can rub his head even when he is eating. Not a greedy dog. When u ask him to stay, he will lie down belly up and will stay in that position. He will be neutered before going to his new home, cost to be borne by adopter. No tying up or caging. Please call if interested.\n",
      "“Fluffy” is a domestic long-haired feline. He was seen wandering around the block opposite mine. He could have been abandoned as he was found without a collar. According to one of the residents, she and her neighbour have been feeding him for the past one week. My husband bumped into him a couple of nights ago when “Fluffy” approached him. We have been feeding him dinner as other times, he went gallivanting and probably found his own meals. “Fluffy” is obviously domesticated which makes him sociable & approachable. He is sweet, affectionate and playful. We would love to keep him (it’s hard not to when he gives us that cute look!) but we already have 3 cats of our own. We think “Fluffy” may be less than a year old, may have been neutered and toilet-trained. We would love to see “Fluffy” find a new loving home where he truly belongs and make sure he'll be in good health. It would be a great waste to let him wander into danger and death. Notes: 1. We appreciate SERIOUS and COMMITTED adopters. If you're below 21yo, please get your parents' consent before writing to me. 2. If interested, please prepare the necessary items in advance like cage (if you need one), food & litter before bringing \"Fluffy\" home. We do not provide any of these. 3. Also, please bring your own pet carrier to transport the cat home. We do no delivery. 4. Get \"Fluffy\" to the vet for a medical check.\n",

It was raining and the roads were noisy and congested with rush hour traffic but little nicholas saw fit to huddle in an overflowing gutter with water gushing all over him and his eyes squinting shut against the raindrops. i stopped my car and approached him slowly not wanting to scare him.. it turns out that the little guy was practically awaiting rescue. he meowed sweetly and allowed me to pick him up with no fuss whatsoever. He was drenched and shivered pitifully but as i held him against my body for warmth he purred appreciatively. Good thing i keep cat food in my car coz this little guy has a shocking appetite!! He immediately ate with gusto, meowing to himself as he chewed and swallowed. when he emptied the container he looked at me as if to say \"is that all?\". when we arrived at my parents' condo, nicholas ate again.. and again.. then immediately latched on to my mother and followed her around. he walked when she walked and sat when she sat. he climbed up on my lap for a nap, then he climbed up on my father's lap, then he climbed up on my brother's lap. Nicholas is not shy at all!! he's super duper sweet!! He has a nice long black tail and another special feature; his right eye is half blue and half light brown. his left eye is brown. how cool is that? For adoption to a safe and loving home.

      "URGENT~this wonderful little guy is George & he needs to find a family to love him. I'm leaving for Canada in 4 days so George needs to find a furever family. He's received all his shots, frontline & has been neutered. He gets along well with other dogs & cats. He actually just tends to ignore cats all together. Like his brother & sister he's huge fan of belly rubs. He's fully housetrained and enjoys his treat reward when he does his business outside. He's very snuggly & loves to be cuddled. He'd make a excellent addition to any dog loving family, could it be yours?\n",

She will tilt her head asking for more and sometimes even crash into your hands/lap, she has a knack for resting herself wherever she wants! ♥ Mabel is a confident girl and always the first to explore (in comparison to her sister, Bessy). She is perfectly fine in the company of other dogs (she likes cats too!). Mabel is not hyper when playing nor is she noisy (unless caged). ♥ Mabel has been going \"potty\" in the garden since her first foster day (% success when going poo, mishaps sometimes when going pee). She will never mess up her sleep/play area. ♥ Mabel is able to eat puppy kibbles independently (she will appreciate some yummy canned/cooked meat now and then though!). ***PLEASE READ: Note For Adopters*** ♥ Mabel will only be ready to leave to a new home in 10 days time (Oct 8th). She has a course of antibiotics to complete. ♥ Mabel will appreciate an indoor environment (adoption priority given to people practicing this). She was initially shy of people but has come out of her shell, her exposure must be maintained. ♥ Mabel MUST be spayed/neutered at the right age (NO breeding).

      "In June,,Mohawk was trapped.Never in his life was he ever confined or looked at 2 feet away by crowd of inquisitive eyes with hostility.Worst still, he was struck on the skull ended up with a medusa shaped wound with raw flesh exposed ( Pic 2 ). Naturally, He was very traumatised. Could we blamed him for behaving aggressively to all near his cage. He was just trying to frighten intruders away to save his own skin. How else ? He is an animal & confined in a cage amidst a crowd of milling people.He was to be euthanized but SAS thought otherwise. It took us 4 months for him to trust us.We named him Mohawk. His colouring is like an Red Indian with a band of white against rich brown diagonally across his neck.His ears are upright.His chest is white & he has white socks too with a bushy tail. Furthermore, he moves as if he is on a hunt. Mohawk is not aggressive at all. Infact, he plays like a child. All our Ketum dogs play like kids. They don't play in any aggressive manners. For a time , he likes to come near & lift the kennel hand's skirt.He loves his name & pricks up his ears whenever called. 2 teenagers lads told their dad he looks like a film star. Indeed, he does & wants him. Mohawk ia a beauty who must have space & one who cares enough to build up a bond with him. When you do , you willbe proud of him for he will give you presence.\n",

      "16 September update: Aura and Solar both adopted by Liz of Bandar Utama! Thank you! : ) Aura & Solar were rescued as part of a 4-kitten litter from a backlane opposite my home on 20 August . and after ensuring that they are in good health and well socialised after almost a month of fostering them, the 2 kittens are now ready to be rehomed. It's difficult to tell them apart as their coat colour and pattern are exactly the same but looking at their eyes, you will be able to differentiate both the kittens. - They have dewormed by a vet on 21 August (RM September (RM12) at a total cost of RM30. - They have been treated with Frontline spray on 21 August to protect against fleas for a month. - I'm feeding them with Vetri-DMG liquid supplement at 0.5mL twice a day. - Their weights are 0.55kg & 0.65kg as at 12 September . - They're eating Earthborn premium dry kitten kibbles. - They drink water from a bowl which is cleaned and refilled twice a day to condition the kittens to only take fresh water as outside contaminated water can damage their health and shorten their life. - They're toilet-trained to use the litter box and I'm using Ever Clean premium litter. - Their poop is solid which is a good indication of good bowel health as well as their overall health. - Aura & Solar have been vaccinated on 12 September at a cost of RM85. - Aura & Solar's behaviour is perfect as pets as they're completely domesticated, playful, curious and affectionate. They would purr happily when held. They are friendly to other cats and kittens (but of course, they must accept them too) as they're well-socialised. The adopter must agree to the following conditions: 1) The kittens must be adopted together because they keep each other company (and out of trouble). 2) The adopter must be a Malaysian. However, I will consider an expatriate adopter if you can provide assurances for Their future when you return to your home country. 3) They must be kept indoors at all times. 4) Vaccinate them yearly to protect against diseases. 5) Apply spot-on medication (Revolution recommended) monthly to protect against ticks/fleas/ear mites/intestinal worms/heartworms. 6) The RM adoption fee must be paid in full as it will only cover their vaccination & deworming costs. Your adoption fee will help the next needy furkid. It would be appreciated if the adopter is on Facebook so that we can get pictorial updates on Aura & Solar. If possible, please adopt Aura & Solar at Sunsuria Avenue (same building as Tune Hotel near Sunway Giza Mall), Kota Damansara on a weekend as I'm working on weekdays. If you're interested to adopt Aura & Solar, please sent a message (via petfinder.my) and please share about yourself (Malaysian/expatriate? Working/student?), your place (eg If renting, landlord allows pets? If living with family/friends, do they agree to pets?) and your cat ownership experience. Please don't just provide a phone number because I won't call/sms and prefer to correspond by e-mail first. Looking forward to hearing from you! :)\n",

So I am tempoarily taking care of them until they get a new loving home. I currently have 4 cats of my own, so to take another 3 under my wing is just too much for my hectic schedule. It wouldn't be fair for them as well. They don't just need a home, but love & attention as well. I'm not charging any fee, but i'll trade them up for Cat's food & litter sand. The reason for the trade is that I want to make sure that the new owner is capable of taking care of them, provide good food & regular check ups & vaccines as needed. They are all litter trained & currently feed on Iams kibbles. They are very playful & curious little creature. Always wondering around every corner of the house. I am willing to bear the cost of spaying the mummy cat 1st if anyone is interested in adopting her as well. If you do need more info on the cats, do get in touch with me via my mobile number. Thank you :)\n",

Now she is spayed and ready to go to a forever home. She is healthy, soft and so friendly. She comes to you and rubs her head against your feet insole to get your attention. Her eyes are so innocent and oh one more thing…..She loves fish so hide your fish or she may steal your meal :D If we do not find a home for Meo, she will be left outside to fight for her life!

      "He's called Yoda because when I found him hiding above a tire under the car engine in the 1Utama car park on 27 May , he was just skin and bones and all big ears and eyes. The name proved to be very apt because he turns out to have tons of attitude, spirit and fortitude. He may be a scrawny under nourished little kitty, but he remains healthy, strong, curious and brave. And from the first day itself, he understands that he's been saved and shows his gratitude by giving head bonks, purrs and belly rolls. Therefore, he is suitable for a person who wants a cat with intelligence and a strong personality with an instinct to protect what he considers as his. Some important info: * His weight on 27 May when he was found was grams. * De-flea and de-worm treatment was done on 27 May. * Vaccination was done on 2 June . Another de-worming was given. On this date, his weight was grams. * Next vaccination is 2 July . The adopter has to make sure his 2nd vaccination is given on time. * Litter box trained. * The adopter has to make sure that he is neutered when he reaches 6 months old to ensure he gets a good chance at a long healthy life. Please email or sms me if you are interested to adopt. Give your name and the reason why you want to adopt. Yoda is a very special kitty, so I would inquire some details from you first.\n",

      "The third pup nicknamed Banana up for adoption, dumped in a vacant house by an irresponsible neighbour. They only get a meal a day. The dogs are always hungry and constantly fight over food. This pup was unfortunate enough to get attacked by a full grown male and had a puncture fang bite on the neck. Good thing I was able to separate them or she would have been a goner. Still a cheerful pup despite the incident but fearful at times. Maybe that's why she went bonkers and fought with B1 in the middle of the night on 30/9/17. First time I see pups fight like adult dogs. Couldn't separate them until I took the hose over and blasted at them. Had to hose them down twice. Then I had to take B1 over for the night and she got grounded in my toilet. Rescues to date: ------------------- Drain drops: 3 Pond drops: 1\n",

      "Boy appeared in front of our gate one day in December. We've been giving him water and food. I think that another neighbour has been feeding him a bit as well. Boy is friendly and allows us and other strangers to pat his head. He also follows my husband around when he walks our own dog. We can't keep him because, as mentioned earlier, we already have a dog and our house compound is not adequate to house 2 dogs. Boy has a ruddy bark, bright eyes, golden-brown fur and a calm but alert disposition. Another rescuer agrees with me that Boy is an abandoned dog. I think that he will make a good watch dog,or a companion to an experienced dog-lover/ owner. He may not be a good guard dog because he is not fierce.

      "Hi cute-looking human out there, I was rescued by my saviour when I was 3 months old. I was sick, and found at a wet market. My eyes were full of discharge, and my nose was blocked. A good market stall seller rescued me, and sent me to a vet. As my saviour has dog, he could not keep me until I am well. He has found me a fosterer, and here, I am given a chance to live until I am healthy. I am very healthy now, I need a permanent home, I don't want to be back on street or market. Please give me a permanent and loving home, and I promise you will not regret this decision. I can be a very good companion, and need very little maintenance. Please call/whatsapp/sms or to adopt me. Our adoption rules are as follow: 1. Kitten must be kept indoors to avoid accidents. 2. Kitten must follow up with the vaccinations. 3. Kitten must be spayed when reaches 6 months old. Rescuer Note: Kitten is not ready to be neutered yet until he/she is 6 months old. It is very important to neuter him/her when he/she is ready, as this will prevent him/her from getting lost. The male cat will wander off your home to find any female cat on heat, while the female cat will wander off when on heat, and will get pregnant. Risk of losing your cat is very high if you don't neuter them. And also your cat may risk injury due to fighting or your furniture will risk damage as well, as un-neutered cat is more aggressive.\n",

Carameow is about 5 to 6 months now and has been spayed. :) ................................................. Carameow and his siblings were rescued from an unfriendly house that they were hanging out at. We managed to the mom(spayed and released) but now the kitties need to find a good family. They’re about 3 ½ months old, and have been dewormed, de-ticked and will have their first vaccination soon. All three of them are not big fans of my rescue dog, Bobo, will scowl or hiss at her when she comes too near, otherwise, i think they just tolerate dogs. Carameow has very similar markings to his sister, Flan. While Flan has blotches of darker tone (with white undertone), Caramel’s darker tone covers almost his entire body. Like the other two kitties, he loves to run and play around the house, but sometimes bumps into boxes and things. He’s a bit of a clumsy cat. Am looking for a good family who will spay him and care for him. Please watsapp me at or email me at if you are interested. Thanks!\n",

Decided to foster it and find him a new home as he's too tiny and young to be alone outside(especially during this wet and cold season), I'm guessing it is only around 2-3 weeks old as it still doesn't know how to drink on it's own so I've been feeding her warm milk. Jingle bell is an golden orange color kitten with big and round black eyes, it has some white color on his paws like he's wearing socks. A very pretty kitten I would say.

      "Woof! Can you please be my master and give me a forever home? My name is Lucy. I'm a 4-year old female Pinscher crossbreed, and I'm lucky to be alive. Earlier this year, I was captured by DBKL officers and put in the dog pound. I was scheduled to be euthanized, until me and 60 other dogs were rescued by a local animal welfare association. Our story even made it into the newspapers :-) Nobody knows my past before that, but everyone says I used to have a master because I know how to sit on command! After I got rescued, a couple from Bandar Utama tried taking me into their home. I love them and I love my new home, but I can't get along with their siberian husky. The couple has been trying for months to socialize me, but it's not working and they're forced to keep me separated most of the time from them and the husky. Everyone's best guess is that I got bullied while I was in the dog pound, so I just can't share a space with other dogs. The couple says it's unfair for me to spend so much time in isolation, so they need to find me a new forever home. I love people and kids. I love to chase my ball. I'm not fussy with my food. I'm vaccinated but not neutered. I'll lie on my belly for hours and let you tickle me. I'm happy to stay outside. And I'll guard your house with my life and bark whenever a stranger shows up. All I ask for in return is your unconditional love, and that I be kept in a one-dog household. Would you like to be friends? Take me home maybe? Call Ms. at to schedule a play date with me.\n",

      "Very cute kitten looking for a home! We found this little girl abandoned in the street the other day and we brought her home to clean her up and help her find a good family. She is not shy at all! walked right up to us looking for a bite to eat. She was so sweet and friendly that we put up posters in the area to make sure no one had lost a kitten but got no reply. She is about 4-5 weeks old, has beautiful and unique orange and grey markings with a white belly and chest. favorite pass time is cuddling although she loves to play too. She purrs the second you get close to her and loves attention. Whats more impressive is she really entertains herself and is definitely not a high maintenance pet. We travel quite often for business which makes it very difficult to keep a pet in the house. The sooner we find her a good home the better as we will be leaving the country several times in December! Please contact me if you would like to see more pictures, have any questions or would like to come meet her in person. I cant stress enough what an amazing pet she will make!\n",

She has been with me for three months and is loving when the other cat isn't around, but prefers to follow around the big cat. She can also be skiddish at times and I think she would like a quiet home. She was spayed and is now able to be adopted. She is about 5-6 months old and is perky, fun, active, and likes other cats but would easily be a single cat (I had the two cats separated when Pachino was recovering from her spay and she was also happy just having people time :-) Please help me to find her a nice home. Thank you.\n",

      "This puppy is: 1. Female 2. 3 months old 3. White mixture with Brown in colour 4. very cute, healthy and active 5. In Penang A lot of people will think that female dogs will dirty the place or cause male dogs to come when they have period. In actual fact, once the female dogs are spayed, they will not have period any more(The spaying cost is not expensive if you go for government vet). Moreover, my experience is female dogs are easier to be trained for toileting. The conditions for adoption are: 1. Deworm and vaccinate it immediately after you adopt it. 2. Spay it when it's more than 6 months old if you do not want to see abandoned puppies. 3. Treat the puppy with love and make it be part of your family.\n",

      "Hi, I'm looking for a home to adopt Winky, a 4-month old male kitten. He is a curious and smart black kitten that loves to play with paper balls and burrows into plastic bags. He loves a lot of TLC and pampering. He really, really likes to be near people. Sometimes, I think Winky craves the human touch as he tends to follow me around or choose to sleep close to me.

Winky comes with the following items: Kitty litter tray, kitty litter scoop, shampoo, scratchbox, toys, leftover unopened cat food, leftover cat litter, nail clipper, kitty carrier, basket (which he doesn't sleep in usually), food/water bowl.

      "This cute lil puppy is up for adoption! I saw her at the vet & thought that she looks like BOLT. Trust me, she really looks like smaller-eyes-version Bolt. This lousy pic of her doesnt justify how cute she is! My friend had adopted her for nearly 2 months. He gave up on her due to her extremely submissive nature. She does well with other dogs but not so much with human. This is because she used to be a strayed puppy before someone picked her up & sent her to the vet. My friend is not a patient owner. He doesnt like the fact that she runs away everytime we go near her. She loves eating & will only come to you when you have food. Although she is a very submissive dog, she still greeted us when we came back from work. At the moment, she is a dog's dog & not so much of people's dog. She doesnt bark much unless she is playing with other dogs. She gets along very well with one of my mongrel dog. So i assume that she has no problem getting along with other dogs. Please bear in mind that she is not a people's dog as she was a strayed dog previously. I m looking for a very patient & loving owner who is willing to spend time with her & take care of her so that she is not reluctant of interacting with human being. Pls do not give up on her due to her submissive nature. I believe that she will eventually gain more confidence & be a really good companaion!\n",

On Petfinder here alone, already there are more than 5k cats and 7k dogs without owners, not counting those still outside on the streets. Their lives are miserable. We should not add to these numbers and multiply the numbers unnecessarily, adopt more if you can.\n",

      "Adoption fee includes the basic medical expenses of the animal : deworming + neutering + 3 vaccinations + microchip. We have to say that Jacker is a real smart boy - an abandoned Jack Russell who ran into our home compound one morning and tapped at our glass door to seek help! We took him in and found that he was dirty, having bad skin condition and emaciated. It was believed that he had been loitering on street for a long period. After sent him to vet clinic we found that he actually had microchip which showed the details of his 1st owner. His 1st owner told us that he've \"sold\" Jacker to one of his friend and after he contacted that friend who's the 2nd owner, he said Jacker actually ran out of the house and he don't want this dog anymore.(WE'RE EXTREMELY ANGRY WITH HIM). The 1st owner told us that they no longer have time to take care of pet and since then, Jacker stay with us and start his new life. Jacker's very very scared of human touch when we first found him. He kept trembling when we get near him and get frightened when you've big action. We're not sure what kind of bad experiences he went through but we're pretty sure that both of his ex-owner didn't treat him good! Jacker is a completely different boy now after staying with us for few months, he's happy, friendly with every dogs, loves to have pat on head, loves to run and walk around when he's happy, not aggressive to strangers anymore and the skin condition is fully recovered. But please note that he will still keep a distance with stranger, get a bit frightened if you've have big action and he do urine marking in house. Interested to adopt? Kindly read our requirements: - Strictly NO tying/caging for long period - Agree to bring him for yearly vaccination - Provide balanced meals and fresh water all the time - Allow for home visit - Love and treat him like your own precious family members Please give a home to Jacker ♥\n",

      "Mama Mia is a special case we've met. All her 5 pups have found their homes leaving MaMa behind (she is spayed), making her living on the harsh streets, she is very shy and gentle. often being bullied by other dogs and had to starve. We went to feed her today, we found her hiding under a car. Much to our surprise, she recognized us immediately and made her way to us, tail wagging furiously. It was when I touched her, that it made my heart soar. Despite being beaten and chased away by human, her face tells me she was so longing for that human touch. That few seconds, she was loved, she was special. And that few seconds, meant the world to her. Today we received the sad news that two of Mama Mia's buddies was poisoned to death :( It is very dangerous for this sweet girl to stay on the streets... If anyone is able to give this special girl a home and lifetime of love, please contact: SANDY CHA-\n",

      "Introducing Noel! This girl has a beautiful white coat with bright orange patches. Oh, and hazel green eyes to die for! Rescued on a rainy Christmas afternoon at a street junction in Petaling (Friday). After a brief moment of petting, the darling decided simply to 'adopt' us, she kept tagging along wherever we went. (It's like she knew it HAD to be me, that i'd finally give in to such temptations and take her with me). I can be such a kitty magnet at times... This lady is extremely sweet and manja. I don't think she's had much attention from anyone during her life on the streets. Thus, i'd prefer it if she's able to go to a new home where she'd have other kitts to play around with...either that or lots and LOTS of human attention :] She's able to take solids already (currently on RC Kitten diet) and is clever with the litterbox. If you would like to give this girl a good, loving home, please contact me or drop me an e-mail. Details on your past experiences with cats will be much appreciated. Thank you!\n",

None of the enforcement with equipment to help take her pups from drain, of the two persons, I am smaller in size so I went as far as my head can stick inside the drain hole and got her two pups. No sign of life of the other two. We relocated her to a safer spot. All this happened within vicinity of morning market of Jalan TK1/1 Taman Kinrara, Puchong, Selangor. Most recently, her male pup was adopted. Left now with only her girl pup. However, I am afraid she might contact disease or other sickness from the villagers' dogs. They have a total of about dogs. I have been feeding her each morning and evening. I live in Puchong Jaya. I need to take her off the streets fast also because some of the dogs go about in packs, before she learns their street ways and joins in. The adoption fee is more to help cover some cost involved like rice & chicken liver. Anyone wishing to adopt her and her remaining pup, please contact me directly or liase with Malaysian Dogs Deserve Better as MDDB has stated they will provide some support to fosterer.

      "Urgently seeking fosterer or adopter! Currently in Jalan Gasing Hospital! But can only stay there til the end o this week!! :( (IF THIS IS YOUR DOG CONTACT ME ASAP) My friend found this poor doggy outside her mother-in-law'a house area. He was just lying there in the muddy ground, and was quite weak to stand up, but was mild mannered. My friend never handled a dog before and though she was a little afraid, she has been feeding him and giving him water for the 2 days that he was there. They did not know who is the owner but he sure was either abandoned or somehow dragged himself? It seems unlikely that he is just lost when his two hind legs are too weak to stand for more than 6 seconds. She called me for help as I had some experience. While trying to figure out what to do, a kind lady with her husband who had seen the dog before came back to help. In the end I managed to convince my mum for the dog to stay just overnight til the couple and I bring \"Bobby\" to the vet the next day coz it was already late evening. Her husband and the lady herself have helped bringing the dog to the vet, as well as financially giving as much as they can. BUT THEY CANT FOSTER/ADOPT THE DOG because they were not used to dogs as well them being muslims. >> Please do contact me via whatsapp if you can foster the dog. He is really sweet, really!! A bit of a lazy whiny bum, but he is gentle. But does not do well with cats, mind you. Overall, he is a good dog. And overall health is alright, just the hind legs are swollen due to arthritis or old age, which needs surgery or physio. But our concern is to find a fostering home first. Financially, we can try to raise fund.\n",

      "Adoption fee covers the basic medical expenses of the animal : 3 vaccinations + spaying surgery fees. We're cooperated with some vet clinics to get discount medical fees for adopted pets. Little Pudding is looking for a home sweet home! Pudding is a cute, sweet and friendly dog, she's not those very naughty type of pup and most of the time she can play by her own and she do not really like to play with other dogs. Pudding was found days ago beside a huge rubbish bins and was hiding under an abandoned sofa, was barking fiercely to us out of fear. We heard from the residents there that she was there for three days and some kind hearted kids there offered her some foods and drinks. We strongly feel that she was being ABANDONED there as we've already spayed all the female street dogs around that area and there's no newcoming mommy dog, and Pudding stayed at that area for three days without moving to other places to look for foods (there's no coffee shop near to her) and apparently she's waiting for someone. Pudding found with lots of fleas, tangled hair and some minor wounds. We've defleas her, do her some simple grooming and treat her wound. But after fostering her for days we found a weird behavior of Pudding - she used to pee and poo inside the cage even when the door of the cage is opened and even after a long time of playing time at the garden, and she can stay really quiet inside the cage unlike other puppy who do not like to be caged. We strongly suspect again that she was being caged all the time before she was being abandoned. What kind of life she was having previously? We really can't imagine that. And so we must find a owner who really love her, and also patient enough to correct her toilet manner. Interested to adopt? Please kindly read our requirements: - No tying/caging for long period - On leash when bring her out - Keep her indoor all the time - Agree to bring her for yearly vaccination - Provide balanced meals and fresh water all the time - Allow for home visit - Love and treat her like your own precious family members Please give a home to Pudding ♥\n",

      "My family adopted Techik since she's been coming to our house for meals daily (she was originally a stray cat). One of the reasons why we did not let her stray anymore is because she comes into our compound regularly and mixes with our 2 home cats. We did not want her to be sick when she roams around outside and infect the kitties at home. However, it's been almost half a year that she's staying with us now but have not been able to get along well with the the kitties at home (she's quite active and playful but they are not, which makes the environment quite stressful sometimes for all of them). So, we hope that someone with great patience would be able to adopt her and give her forever home that she can be herself without any barriers. Preferably a home without cats as she can be quite feisty around other cats.\n",

She urged us to get a new home for her in a short time. Pokky is a intelligent, alert and manja girl, sometimes she's just bit naughty due to her young age.

I am allergic to cats and I am a living in a condo , so I am not allowed to keep him for too long. He is domestic medium/long-haired + blue eyes + light yellow at the ears and tail.

      "I found her & her brother wandering about near my house during a thunderstorm, soaked to the bones & mewing pitifully. Their mother was no where to be found. Judging from their sizes & eye color, they still need their mother so I left them. The next morning, I found them huddled in a corner, still cold, wet & very hungry. I gave them a little milk & some cat food which they gobbled up (indication of teeth). I did not pet nor touch them, fearing that the mother might abandon them. After work, I found them at the same corner, once again mewing pitifully. Since it looked like their mother did not return for them, I took them in.\n",

      "I am searching for a kind, quiet, sensitive owner for Arthur. Even someone who can take him as a ýard cat and just give him shelter and food would be fine. This young cat was the victim of abuse and had a terrible wound (probably from boiling water or oil) when I found him struggling to live in a drain. He has had surgery and is left with no visible scars. He has recovered well and is now ready to be re-homed. Arthur would do best in a home with an older owner; no young children, other male cat or dogs. He is a very clean cat and is litter trained. He is healthy, de-wormed, de-flead, vaccinated and neutered. He is very affectionate and loves to be stroked. He is however still shy and nervous and needs a patient, caring owner. Please sms- or e-mail if you think you can give Arthur a kind and loving home. Thank you.\n",

      "This is Fat Boy, a special one. He is a cat who lives with dog in a Temple since small. He was trained to play rough by a muscular Judo Master. He acts like dog. Whenever he's tired or nervous, he'll start to breath fast, and stuck his tongue out, like a dog. Juliane (his owner) took Boy home for the first time, Boy barks. Later then he learns to meow. Other than Boy, there's Kate. She has nerve problem. Her brain deteriorates day by day and now Juliane focus on Kate who needs full attention. Every time Kate gets panic attack, that's when the brain will slowly damage. So the more panic attack Kate gets, the more brain damage she'll suffer. Because of Kate's condition, moreover Kate can't see other cat else she'll start to get panic, Juliane decide to put Boy for adoption. Boy is at my place (Bubu's Shelter) now. Though he's big, he's domesticate. When he bonds with you, he'll start suckle your palm. That's how he shows affection. I've train him not to play with human hands, but sometimes he does. But he's a fast learner, so if you show that you're angry when he bites your hand or feet, he'll understand his mistake and stop doing it. So whenever he's hyper, make sure you have toys for him. He has also learn how to socialize. Adopter criteria: I need someone who's confident handling him. Better with experience and someone who's responsible and committed. view video of him suckling palm:\n",

      "20 April update: MinPin is on trial adoption MinPin was found on a busy road and is being put up for adoption since no one claimed her. She's now believed to be abandoned due to her cataract. Due to her early cataract which is probably genetically inherited, she can only see shadows from her right eye although she has good vision from her left eye. This would caused her to panic and start protecting herself by snapping if there's any sudden movement. However, when she knows you, get used to your voice, she will be as adorable as a kitten. In addition, due to her cataract problem and her not being well socialized, she will start barking whenever there's dogs or cats near her so she may not be suitable to multi-pet homes or has to be monitored when around other pets. As she was likely abandoned by her owner and probably had to fight for food while on the streets, she is still protective over her food while she's eating, so it's best not to disturb her when there's food in front of her. Behavior: - She's toilet trained, will only pee and poo outside the house. - She can walk off leash, she will follow the clapping sound when you want her to follow. - healthy and fit, loves to be with humans. - Her personality and attitude is more suitable for a family that do not have other pets but the adopting family has to be patient when dealing with MinPin and she will eventually listen and be an extreme cute girl when she gets to know you better. The adopter should be active on Facebook so that we can get pictorial updates on the dog and forgo the need for physical visits to check on her. By the way, MinPin was featured in Star newspaper on 16 February under the Dog Talk column. Thank you, Ellen Whyte! If you're interested to adopt her, please sent a message (via petfinder.my) and tell me about yourself especially your dog ownership experience and do expect an interview.\n",

      "//Update: Eaton found a loving home on 26FEB14// Eaton was found in a 5 metres-deep drain with both front and hind legs tied up. According to the people around, he has been there for 2-3 days. We rushed Eaton to the nearby vet where he was given intensive care. As a result of the ties, there are ligature marks on all his four legs. Eaton is now recovering and we are seeking for animal lover to open their heart for Eaton. Eaton is timid due to the way he was treated. Once he gained your trust, he will be your best buddy. We are not charging any adoption fee as all we hope is for the adopter to care and love Eaton. Goodwill donation is welcomed to ease our medical fee burden. To qualify you to own Eaton, here is our requirement : 1) Adopter must be a Malaysian or a PR. If you are below 18 years old, we will require your parents to speak with us on the adoption procedure. 2) Adopter must be an animal lover and preferably have experience in handling dog. 3) No long hour of caging or tied on leash. 4) Provide necessary medical needs (vaccinations, deworming, flea/tick/heartworm prevention etc.) 5) Adopter must add us on Facebook so we can receive her progress update. 6) During the intial stage of adoption, allow visitation so we can ensure Eaton is adjusting well to his new environment. For this reason, adopter residing in Klang Valley is highly preferred. 7) Approval for this adoption is only for the successful adopter. Eaton cannot be transferred to third party without seeking our permission. 8) We reserve all rights to remove Eaton from you if he is found to be neglected under your care. If you're interested to adopt Eaton, please contact me by sms, e-mail or call. Provide us your details (particular, type of house and experience with dogs).\n",

      "A cute domestic short hair kitten looking for new home. She about 3.5 months old now. She has snowy white fur with green-grey marks on her body. She has beautiful, big, round, golden-copper eyes. She also has a short, cute, fluffy bob-tail. She is quite shy compared with other kittens, so we named her Shy Girl. She is a bit slow warmed up when playing with other kittens. However, she is very \"gentleman\" during eating. She always let others eat first and she will eat last. She is feeding on kibbles already. She is healthy, very cute and gentle on movement, so she is very suitable to be an indoor pet. She has her flea treatment done on 19th May. She was de-wormed today, 20th May. She is well toilet (potty) trained & is ready to go anytime. *RM 50 adoption fee would be paid to Cat Charity Club (CCC) for rescuing stray cats. *Another RM neutering / spaying deposit would be fully refundable once the surgery is done. Anyone interested, please call .\n",

      "'Old doesn't make one redundant'...This is the story of a special girl with every loving name. She is sadly Heartworm positive and will be treated for it..She was officially fostered on the 13th of Feb and will be under the care of a very kind samaritan for 2 months. We hope a suitable person would come forward to welcome her with open arms with a forever home..we know she is at that age but has been through a lot. Can you imagine having a choke collar on yourself, your whole life? See the 'rafia' tied on her choke collar? Yes, I got it snipped off and hopefully the fosterer would be able to get her choke collar off. What is wrong with human beings! The Starbucks trip could wait, Starbucks won't go anywhere. Even if one Starbucks gets demolished, more would appear..But there are billions of animals in need and there will always be one buddy or clara or we will call her every loving name in the entire world!..Just like there is only one of us out of the billions of people out there. If you want a dog that is just there as an accessory or if you just want a dog that is healthy, I guess you don't have to read further but I hope the least you could do is place yourself in her shoes and share about her. I been asked if her chances of being adopted is high. I don't have a crystal ball people, I'm not God either so your question is bizarre to me, but as bleak as it may seem to many of you, I want to remain hopeful that a responsible and caring adopter would come forward wanting to care for her like a child who would stand by their elderly parent with ailments. Buddy was sent to me I believe..God had a task for me on that day. That day where a man cockily rang the bell and asked me to place water for the dog. Of course I would though I was put off by him. Man claimed dog followed him from the bus stop but he was reluctant to stay even for one minute with the dog while I gathered the food, the water? Doesn't click. Dog wanders up and down..people, hah, people were so unkind in general. I could go 'excuse me sir, excuse me, excuse me maam' and what? They just ignored me. To top it off, employer appeared displeased with the dog's presence, but adviced on placing food at the bus stop and just letting her wander off. If one knows me well enough, such 'advices' goes into into my left ear, out through my right ear. I made calls in secrecy. Managed to find a neighbour of this kind couple who housed her for two nights. 8 am the next day, I had to collect her. Would be at work with me but I was only allowed to place her outside of the clinic (yup, I work in an animal clinic indeed). Imagine the scorching heat, imagine the thunder, the rain and I couldn't. Mind you, couldn't even board her. Not because I had no money. I was simply not allowed to. As shitty as that was, good thing, I went by what I stood for and I wasn't a moron to listen to such advices. I've my own personal values. I would have slept with her outside of the clinic at night if that was what it took even because no way was I going to leave her to fend for herself. Thankfully a kind lady contacted me through the internet and agreed to foster her for 2 months. So again fellow Malaysians or expats or people holidaying here etc, before you go for your next Starbucks fix or debating on what clothes to buy, please take a moment and reflect on this. The fosterer and me are really hoping we could find a suitable person to give her a permanent home...We want the end of her days to be filled with love, compassion... If you are that person, please contact me Yasmin at. Its best for you to sms me first because I work such long hours. More pictures and any necessary updates will be provided. We can't predict what will happen within this two month period but..we do need fosterers as a back up.. So please, we could end up like Clara..alone, lost, left to wander about when we're old, hoping for the mercy of another human being. Think about it. Someday, we could be sitting outside of Starbucks, begging for dough..from the outside, looking in and all of the 'too caught up with the Starbucks buzz' people who reminded you of yourself when you were younger would all turn a blind eye at you and hey, remember back then that dog you didn't want to give your time for? Reality would blow you real hard when you see a dog wandering on the streets, comforting you. Just think about it. Its no Hollywood script. Its reality. Think about it. If what I just wrote does hit you somewhere, then hit me up. Otherwise, just turn the page. Kindly, Yasmin\n",

He finds it very hard to relax when he's nervous, so he comes across as being a little wound up - but he's just trying to find his place. He likes feeling safe and cozy, doesn't eat much, and eventually will be the sort of kitty that curls up on your lap - making you feel loved after your long day at work. We are migrating to canada, and i'm afraid of what the cold will do to him. He's capable of becoming your best friend, and more importantly, you'll be his best friend - all he needs is time.\n",

They were not fed regularly, especially in the last few days before the owner gave them up to us. Due to the small space, one of them would always end up sleeping on the dirty litter, or topple their water and food bowls - which were not replaced. I We could not bare to watch anymore, so we pestered the owner to give them to us. We felt that it is better for them to be with someone else, or roam around the streets to find their food rather than being kept like prisoners in their cage. They were hungry and smelly when we took them and would purr contentedly as soon as we touch them. We already have 5 cats - all rescued kittens - sharing our small apartment, we hope that you could give Latte a loving home.\n",

      "Little Stacey was a stray kitten that had been wandering the streets for roughly a week. I know because she has the loudest mews and I can hear her a few houses away. She was sleeping under cars, ON car tires and IN car engines far too much for my comfort. I keep worrying that she might get trapped in there or get run over one day. So I decided to rescue her and try to find a new home for her. Little Stacey was a lost kitten I think, there weren't other kittens and no female cats around that could look like her momma. She was always alone under cars or in drains. Stacey is a feisty little thing, she will hiss at strangers, but will not usually bite or fight back. She is a very vocal kitten, hyperactive and loves to play with anything and everything. Stacey can be manja at times but most of the time she will prefer to run around curiously to explore every nook and cranny. She had been dewormed, but not vaccinated. Litter trained, and eats Fussy cat wet food + Acana kibbles. Stacey is a brown tabby with no tabby markings on her body, just on the head, legs and tail. The tips of her ears are black, so is her tail, which I suspect is from a Siamese heritage. She has white paws, which is very cute. :) If interested, please e-mail me at or SMS me at.

However, I was worrying too much about helping them to search for the perfect owner and to be honest I was really reluctant to give them away until I found this website. Below are the basic info about them. Name: Simba She was name after the lion called 'Simba' from the \"Lion King\" due to her fur colour. She has golden brown fur from head to toe, a pair of sparkling golden brown eyes and a cute pinky brown nose. She is very active and friendly, but a little shy when it comes to meeting strangers. However, I believed after a few days, she will be just fine and friendly with the \"stranger\". She loves running around and naps when she is tired of running. Simba is more of a big sister to Sandy as Sandy always follow Simba around whenever she goes. Besides that, she is also very loving and I believed that she is not any less good than popular dog breeds like Golden Retriever. Name: Sandy She is sister of Simba and was named after the squirrel called Sandy in Spongebob as her personality is the completely opposite with the Squirrel in Spongebob so I thought it would be cute to name her Sandy. She has short shiny coated black fur from head to toe, an innocent pair of black eyes and a black nose. Her personality is very similar to Simba as she is very shy, active, loves running around, loving and innocent. Both of them are the perfect family dogs and they can guard the house pretty well. #FunFacts about them that make them adorable: 1. They are afraid of fireworks. 2. They are always wag their tails when you are home! 3. They love being pet and never get sick of being complimented. 4. Just simply because they are super ADORABLE AND LOVABLE!\n",
      "Yogi Boy and Maya Girl, both are very healthy, friendly and well potty trained kittens, content with dry food and tap water. Will poo n pee outdoors if we provide sand pit, or in the litter box, if indoors. Yogi is all we hit with blue eyes and Maya is tuxedo with green eyes I will pay for the neutering and spaying, if they get adopted, just now they are too young. My problem is I have to h o overseas soon for long term.\n",

      "This guy's name is Pollux or atlas that's what I've been calling him. I found him in Taman Jaya Park with his friend, Castor and they both looked like they were very recently abandoned. Super friendly and possess a very nice temperament, both of them came running when I called and started running around me util they tired out, then asked for belly rubs. He would make ann amazing family dog given the chance.\n",
      "Rufus was found in Taman Tun parks. Probably lost for a few days because he was very hungry when a kind samaritan took him in. He has a very unique golden brown coat and a solidly built body. Calm, knows how to sit and give paw. Currently being fostered but urgently need a new home.\n",

      "I'm the owner of Goldie since it was a puppy. Seeing it learns how to walk and run, I feel so glad that it grew up healthily. Everyday I wake up, it will wait me in front my room door, shaking its tail. It loves to tag along with me. It is friendly, lovely, caring and loyal. Even it is just a small pet dog can guard the house well. It likes to rest on my lap and likes to play fetch. I love it so much. I give out Goldie not because it misbehaves but i'm unable to take care of it anymore. My university hostel doesn't allow me to take care of it and my family can't look after it because they have their own problem. I really hope it lands in a good hand, please feel free to contact me if you are interested. FYI, I will impose an adoption fee because I hope its new owner will remember its birthday, which is on 25 May .\n",

      "We rescued her from a park in USJ2. It had been raining heavily nonstop when we discovered her by chance. She was very weak, starving, cold and most probably she barely had strength to move but when we tried to help her she responded with a domesticated attitude. We brought her home from the rain because we know she would die if we didn't help. when we brought her home she responded quite affectionate. However she wasn't very active cause she was still very tired and also had a slight limp. She looks like she is a american eskimo although I doubt she is a pure breed. When we found her she wasn't smelly even. when she was fully soaked. Which lead us to conclude that she hasn't been homeless for more than 5 days. We have asked around the neighbourhood to try to find the owner, however we feel that she was abandoned. Our situation dosnt allow us to permanently adopt her since we are students with a very limited income. As well as we are already caring for a beautiful dog who we rescued 3 years ago. She already seems well mannered and obeys when prompted to sit. The only negative we noticed is that she guards her food with an attitude. We think this is because she may had had to defend for her self when she was out on the street. Additionally she got along fine with our dog after the initial excitement of being introduced. Watsapp me if you're interested. Thanks\n",

      "之前它常常跟随一位顾客来我们的咖啡店，它给我的印象就是很瘦，总是被主人骂，常常追跑在它主人的车后。突然消失了一段时间，还以为可能被抓狗队抓去了，因为我们这常常都有抓狗队，试过连续三个星期每天都来。去年 日傍晚它突然出现在我们店外，更加瘦了，脚还一拐一拐的，还有那无助的眼神，本以为或者给它一顿饱饭后好回家，它没吃饭，只是躲在一角，我想它应该是需要帮忙了，拖了我的狗笼往它方向走，辛好它的信任只是凶了我一下，没有把我咬。一整晚在笼子里面不吵不闹，就是很不舒服的样子。隔天幹紧把它送给兽医做检查，原来前脚是因为与其它的狗狗打架而化脓了，必须立刻开刀清洗，不然将会因脓毒而身亡。本来想着将它医好还给它主人，我清楚这位顾客并不会替我分担医药费，想着也算了，我只是可怜这毛孩。但是问题来了，从这位顾客朋友口中知道，原来这位主人从来不曾给它饭吃，难怪它那么瘦，更加生气的是工厂的孟加拉工人常常拿铁条往它身上抽，还试过被打得头破血流，难怪我常看见它四处游荡，其实是不敢回家。听后真的很生气，也不可能放它回地狱。兽医也很清楚我的情况与环境，不敢让它载回给我。如今它在兽医处已经超过2个月，住院费也不停的增加中，未知之数。那是因为我已经要照顾23位毛孩，大部分都是我这六年来挽救接近一百只毛孩而未能找到属于它们永远的家的孩子们，身为一位浪浪挽救者，我清楚知道我们所要面对的问题，并非每只都能幸运的找到属于它们的家。出不了的百年归老我们也只好都扛下了。这六年来我都自己照顾着它们，偶尔亲戚朋友的帮助让我减轻一些负担，如今我欠下一屁股债，欠下兽医 3 千多的医疗费，还未包括这毛孩的。幸好我的兽医从来都不曾催我还钱。她很清楚我的环境和能力。兽医只是常常告诉我不要再救了，或者你又扛上身啊！ 哈哈！我就是熬不过自己对毛孩的那分同情心，如果我们不帮它们将会更可怜了。可是一个人的力量实在太有限了。我每天除了要忙咖啡店，父母已经 六十多岁，还要照顾23位毛孩们，我已经没有能力收留照顾更多了。而且我家是咖啡店，还收养了那么多毛孩，被抓狗队吃了不少钱之外，也很担心被投诉，到时除了要被逼关门之外可能还会把我所有的毛孩都抓走，真的很怕。。。除了分享一下我的小故事，我是希望有心人可以帮帮忙让这可怜的毛孩有个休养的地方，或者让它找到一个属于它的家，疼它的主人。医疗费我会想办法，或者慢慢还，现在只想尽快让它出院，好好休养。如果你们可以帮个忙请联络我，感激不尽! 我在 KL 的，我的联络号码 - 谢谢！\n",

She asked me to help feed the cats so they won't go hungry. Of the cats, there is one I adore. She has beautiful coat & her fur is really long, soft & fluffy. She looks very clean too, nothing like a stray. Not sure of her age, but she doesn't look old. Also quiet and doesn't meow very much unlike some of the other strays I feed. She is a very manja & timid cat but gets bullied by the others who will try to steal her food. I thought she really deserves a better life than to live as a stray. Unfortunately, I have a very selfish dog that refuses to allow me to adopt other dogs, let alone cats. I've spent quite a fair bit of money to get her spayed, vaccinated, dewormed & Frontlined.

She likes to play with a crumpled piece of paper and carries it with her mouth around the house. She loves watching birds video on youtube too. She could stare at them monitor for hours on end! Schmoopy is an absolute bundle of joy to have. She likes to be around hooman especially during nap time. She gets along really well with other furry creatures too! Schmoopy is no picky eater by all means. She's really easy to take care of.

My neighbours and I spent more than two hours in the wee hours of morning climbing into the drain to fish this little cutie out. This little boy will literally melt your heart. He's got the bluest blue eyes ever. He's only a month old but he's got quite a personality! He's feisty and vocal. He lets you know his preferences. He's eating and pooping well, and likes a lot of attention. He's got some sort of an eye infection, which I will happily pay the treatment of. He needs a loving home - ideally a multi-cat home! Please message us if you want to adopt this adorable little boy!\n",

      "\"I know black kitties like myself are stereotyped as being least adoptable, but I didn't come this far for nothing and my plan is to prove everyone wrong!\" --------------------------------------------------------------- Introducing handsome Bagheerah! ♥ Bagheerah was a stray cat rescued from a restaurant in Puchong on the 2nd of March, . ♥ He had an awful case of mange at the time and was also incredibly thin and malnourished. A check at the vet found hookworms, fleas and also that he had flu. Bagheerah has since bloomed tremendously and is now seeking a loving family. --------------------------------------------------------------- Details: ♥ Bagheerah is an EXTREMELY affectionate boy and loves, loves, LOVES people! (Please view videos below, although only visits could do his character justice!). ♥ A softie - Bagheerah is extremely gentle. Would do great in homes with elderly people or children. He never uses his claws except when playing or giving love nips. ♥ He's friendly around other (non-agressive) cats as well, submissive and calm. Adapts very quickly to new environments! ♥ Bagheerah been fully vaccinated, dewormed (twice), is scheduled for neutering. He is clever with the litter box and not fussy about food. Hands down one of the best cats we've ever fostered! :) --------------------------------------------------------------- ***Important (Note for adopters)***: ○ Bagheerah would prefer being kept % indoors for his own safety. He loves trips to the garden under supervision now and then. Apartments best if cat-safe. ○ He would also appreciate a healthy diet (no commercial foods like Whiskas, Friskies etc). This is for the long term welfare of any cat, feel free inquire if unsure. Please drop me an text (WhatsApp) or call directly if you feel that you may be just the right person to give this boy a new life. Thank you! :)\n",

Please sms if you want to see their pics. They are not vaccine yet. For those who want to adopt these furkids and give them a loving home please sms me.\n",
      "more about him: 1) loves children 2) very gentle 3) loves the company of another dog (adopting his brother too would be great!!!) 4) curious about cats (but don't attack) 5) loves running 6) enjoys human attention * * * * * This adorable, obedient, affectionate dog was found in Ara Damansara along with two other \"strays\" - one black, another his colour with patches too. He has on a frayed yellowish collar, so he could've been lost for a while, as he's also very skinny, and he's already neutered when found. Estimated age to be about 1 year old, as he still pees like a gal and has young teeth and good skin. Found in Ara Damansara, though he could've come from anywhere if he's been lost for sometime. He knows how to sit, shake hand and come. He can walk off-leash following people (those who show kindness to him). He sits well in the car. VERY PEOPLE FRIENDLY (so must've been treated very well by humans during his early months). He was hanging around near an unoccupied house in the residential area with the two other dogs despite occasionally being beaten by one particular resident who dislike \"strays.\" They also take shelter at a nearby field in the residential area. They've been roaming the area probably since December . If nobody claims him in a week, we'd like to have him adopted! This is a dog that will reward it's keepers with affection and guarding of family property! He is kept at a neighbour's house for a few days, and he will bark at unknown passers-by and unknown cars parked near the house. Would be great if adopters take in another of his buddies from the streets too. He loves attention and freedom. When chained, will whine CONTINUOUSLY for attention if he knows that dog-lovers are within hearing distance. When left to roam free within the compound of the home, he's a real darling! He's quiet, he naps, he's playful when people are around, he's alert when he sees strangers - the perfect dog for a family who'd spend time playing and running/walking him! He makes a wonderful companion dog as well as an alert dog (eg. alert family of possible intruders). Would be great if new owners can take in 2 or more pets. We've taken in this lovely dog and his 2 companions, and he seems to love having other dogs around! Note: SAFE AROUND CATS! He's curious in chasing and approaching them, but non-agressive and stays 2 feet away from usually hissing cats that he approaches! update on: 1st Feb Open for adoption!!! This darling doggie is now kept with another stray who appears to be the \"brother\". The brother was found intact, and when they first started roaming Ara Damansara, was average in weight. however, after roaming for over a month (as sighted by rescuer), he got skinnier and skinnier. The brother is very good on leash, hardly barks, just wags tail when see loving humans and doesn't jump. would be great if a family can adopt BOTH DOGS, as they tend to be happier and quieter and get to play together.\n",
      "UTIH adalah salah sekor dari 5 beradik yg di tinggalkan di hostel BMI unikl di gombak. Mereka ditinggalkan tanpa ibu. Keadaan mereka sangat menyedihkan. Kelaparan, ketakutan dan kesejukkan. Usia mereka dlm lingkugan 2 minggu waktu tu. Mereka diserahkan oleh seorang pelajar bmi yg baik hati. Dia sanggup selamatkan dan serahkan pada saya. Kini UTIH dan yg lain dah besar, kuat, sihat dan ceria. UTIH kuat makan dan kuat nenen. Apa apa pasti dia yang nak dulu. UTIH pandai merayu suara sedih minta nenen atau makan. UTIH penakut sikit dari yang lain. Nakal UTIH seperti anak anak kucing yang lain juga.

      "If your cat is lonely, here is the perfect solution: a cat who loves other cats. BonBon was the only survivor from 5 siblings and was abandoned by her mother so I took her in. She used to be alone. I let her stay in my house with my other cats so she can have friend. She doesn’t mind being around with the adults and just be herself. She is playful, independent and sweet. Her energy level is high and she is very active. She doesn't really like to be cuddled. She likes to play rough. She doesn't meow a lot. She can get along with other cat; just give her time to adjust. She is suitable with a home with 1 or two adult cats. Younger kitten may be bullied by her because she is the baby in my house. Important : This is not an average pet, a cat who will sit on your lap, who love being petted and cuddled. I have her almost 2 months, and catching her to trim her claws or just to hold her still is an ordeal.But she really likes to play, all my cats will lose interest but she's the only one who still eye-balling the toys e.g feather teaser.She never comes to me and rubs herself just like my cats greet me. The only time she's interested to me is when it's feeding time or when no one wants to entertain or play with her. Sometimes she bites to get what she wants. I can give you some advice on how to handle her. If you want her to keep another cat company, she is perfect! And pretty low-maintenance,you can just give her food and water and that's it. Please give BonBon a loving home. With love, patience and affection from you, I'm sure she will be the most loving bouncy furkid you ever had. Please take note: Rm is imposed as a safe deposit which will be returned to the owner once the owners spay BonBon within 3 months. Trial period available. *COMMITMENT TO SPAY BonBon IS A COMPULSARY!*\n",

      "2-year old male mixed breed Rosco up for adoption! Neutered, dewormed, vaccinated. Gorgeous mix of colours. He was rescued off the streets as a puppy with his brother and was sent to a shelter. His brother was adopted and since then Rosco grew up alone in a noisy hectic place. He is the sweetest and friendliest dog ever and the only reason why he hasn't been adopted by any dog lover is that he doesn't get along with other dogs. With humans, he is an absolute angel. Friendly, playful, smart, obedient. But somehow, volunteers have been working really hard to get him over his only vice (hostile to other dogs) and haven't been successful. Hence, he urgently needs a loving home whereby he will be only dog and will be showered w TLC and cuddles. He would be a great companion and pet for anyone as long as he is the only dog in the house. He is a real sweetheart and even has a heart on his forehead! Please PM me if you want to adopt this darling and help share and spread the word to anyone you know who's had dogs, but doesn't have one at the moment and wants one and only one now :)\n",

I assure you he can run fine, pee and poo fine and play fine. His mobility isn't affected by his deformity at all.

      "Help needed ! Mosu Mosu is a mama cat. Her AGE is UNKNOWN. She has pointed colour. Like the siamese. But she is most probably mixed breed. Has blue eyes. She suddenly appeared where we live. So it only means one thing. She's either lost or like most pretty cats that end up here...abandoned. Mosu Mosu is special compared to other cats. Why is a cat like her out here on the streets ?!? She definitely must have been a house cat before. She is very affectionate, gentle and slightly cowardly dealing with other cats but very friendly. She gets attached to humans very quickly. She has never scratched or bit us. but once when I was unconsciously jiggling my house keys, she scratched me accidentally while trying to catch the keys.No wounds. so she plays too I guess. She trusts us waaaay too much. She got herself attached here and when she got pregnant she glued herself here. She behaves absolutely like a house cat ! Seems more intelligent than any other cats here. Maybe due to her mixed breed genes ? -Very well behaved and understands when we say \"no\". -When we let she uses the litter box. When we close it she goes outside to do her \"business\" I'm pretty healthy and had no signs of allergies so far despite having so many stray cats around. But lately I've gotten really sick. It seems I am allergic to Mosu Mosu. She's too furry. Only the mama cat(Mosu Mosu) makes me sneeze and have runny nose. But Mosu Mosu is attached to us and hates and refuses to socialise with other outside cats. So I am hiding the fact that she is making me sick from my family. So I need someone to at least help foster her or something because I don't want to send her to places like PAWS or SPCA. Anyone who likes a cuddle cat who is gentle and affectionate that does not cause trouble will love Mosu Mosu !\n",

      "I really do need to get this pup adopted soon enough, as she may otherwise be put down by the end of next week.:(:( Please help in anyway you can. - Spotted this extremely undernourished dog in ara damansara about a a month plus ago and it has been at the vets for about 5 weeks now, and the vet has informed me that they can't foster her any longer. She's a 6 yo 7 year old dog that's a little anemic and isnt gaining much weight, but otherwise, blood tests and an ultrasound scan has turned up with normal readings. I am unable to foster or adopt her as the family and i are caught up with an infant at home, constant travelling for work, and no extra help - plus, my own dog is a little dog aggressive with other K9s. We would be extremely grateful if you or someone that you know could foster or adopt her. She's very calm, gentle and has really warmed up to everyone these past two weeks, but time is running out. I may have to send her to the shelter and am afraid, that due to her age and frail physique , she may be put to sleep. Please consider giving her a second chance and please do pass this around.

      "Mr CrankyPants is one of the cats in a feral colony that my neighbor and I care for. Unlike the others, he has become extremely tame and affectionate. While this is nice for us caretakers, it has made our sweet boy vulnerable to abuse. We suspect he has been intentionally harmed at least twice. Once he suffered a terrible wound on his chest that looked like he had been scalded with boiling water. More recently he became very ill and we think he was poisoned. Our neighbors have been complaining about the stray cats because they are pampered losers with nothing better to do with their lives. In light of these things against our little Cranks, it is with heavy hearts that we have decided to put him up for adoption. We love him but we are both full with our own pet cats and foster animals at the moment. I cannot afford to give him the quality of life that he so deserves and the attention that he craves. I think Mr CrankyPants would get along best as an only cat, or with a spayed female cat. I say this because he does not get along with the other male cats in the feral colony but he is just fine with the females. What's special about Cranks? Sure, he looks like an ordinary grey tabby but his personality is one in a million. He is the sweetest, most affectionate, and attention-seeking cat I have ever met and believe me I've met a lot of cats! He loves giving cuddles as much as he loves receiving them. When he has bonded to someone, he can't get enough of their love and he is never finished affectionately butting his head on you and expressing his gratitude. This cuddlebunny used to be the king of the colony but now he's a teddy bear. He's already been neutered and is healthy and toilet-trained. All that's left now is to find him his perfect human match. Could that be you? Would you like a kitty as sweet, loving, and loyal as a dog? Then Cranks is the one for you. Email or text me if you're interested. More pictures coming soon! He's pretty hard to photograph because he can't sit still! He's constantly rubbing his head on me and being super duper manja. Please, no caging except in instances of illness of injury. Cranks is a free spirit and he loves exploring.\n",

[For Adoption] Leia the Dalmatian mix (15kg) is 1 year's old in May . Her father is a Dalmatian and her mother is a Dalmatian mix.

We took her in when she was approximately 4 months old and only realize she was partially deaf when she was 5 months old. She has been trained using hand gesture and understand Sit, Stay, Down, and Come. If you intend to adopt her, please read up on how to manage a partially deaf dog. She relies on her nose and can smell you from far away, even without seeing you! She has been spayed in December . She does not have any known allergy and is healthy. She has good appetite and likes kibble or any food (as long as healthy). She is friendly, affectionate, plays well with humans and dogs. She is rather active and is destructive when bored. She's not a guard dog at all. She is wary of strangers at first. If you are keen to adopt her, please send us a message to describe: 1. Your experience handling dog (if any) 2.

      "Hi! My name is Grace, and I am extremely protective of the Jalan which I'm staying at.

      "Hi everyone, this beautiful cat is looking for a loving family and place to call a new home. I rescued it and it was nursed back to health at a vet after having a very bad injury on its leg. He's really friendly and about a year old, judging by what the vet says. It's really urgent I find him a home soon. Do pm me if interested, thank you. I really think he is of a mixed breed as his fur coat and eyes seem to suggest. My guess would be part siamese! Either way, he is really beautiful. Oh and his name is Othman as my family and I found him injured on a street called Jalan Othman, in PJ :)\n",

      "I heard his meowing and I went down there to searching for him, he was caught in the middle of the pots in the pond side, he was half wet... poor thing, he meow very loud to get attention so I found him, thank god his is safe with me now\n",
      "Very friendly, gentle and playful. Not sure boy or girl.\n",
      "It was late at night when I was about to leave from work when I heard loud meowings near my car. I did not have the heart to leave it there as I saw no signs of its mother nearby. So I took it home and fed it with some food and gave it a quick wash. I went to the vet next day and bought a bottle and milk for cats and it has been drinking from the bottle. Not only is he playful and adorable, he is also quite clever as he has been pee-ing at the same place (in a shoe box laid with newspapers). He is always cleaned afterwards. A very friendly and active little guy, purrs almost all the time now especially after being fed (even knows where he can get his milk from!). Unfortunately, my wife and I are not able to look after him as we are both working until late night. We would like to find a home for this little guy, with or without a foster mother cat, as he can already be fed using a bottle, and can already eat soft food. As much as we are already attached to this little fella, we know that being in a house with caring people to look after him, he'd be much better off without a couple of busy people like us. And we would be happy to see him grow with love and become a handsome cat. ----- Updating again after we gave Sim away to his new family. My husband and I cried our eyes out from missing him last night. I still feel all choked up when I look at his pictures and videos. The night my husband brought him in, we didn't have anything suitable to feed a kitten with but an ikan goreng. As desperate as he was, we had to give him something to eat, so ikan goreng it was. And a few drops of Dutch Lady's full cream milk. The next day, we had only planned to drop him at a local vet, in hoping that a good samaritan would take him in, but the clerk said they don't take animals in, so we ended up buying the little fella a bottle and 2 boxes of milk for cats. Since then we had been feeding him the milk. We left Sim at home and when we came back later that night, we saw him sitting quietly at one spot. And we also saw spots of white vomit and yellow-ish liquidy stool. After immediately cleaning him up, Sim looked sleepy. I thought he might be tired from vomiting like humans would. So I wrapped him up and cuddled him. After a while, I thought something was strange about him. Usually he would wake up if there was even a slight movement, this time he didn't even stir. I also noticed that he squirted liquid from his rectum while he was sleeping. It was night, no vets would still be open. So I read up a website, at which describes a condition of a kitten from its stool and urine's color and texture. I suspected that he might be suffering from food poisoning (the ikan goreng and the Dutch Lady milk). I was devastated thinking that Sim might not last that night as his body was so weak, his head just lolled if unsupported, his paws were almost cold, all the signs I though that he was really dying. I couldn't bear the thought of seeing him die all by myself as my husband was at work at that time. All I could do that night was rub him to keep him warm and pray that he'd be ok. I was already so smitten by this kitten, although we couldn't keep it, I really wanted it to live. Miraculously, my prayers were answered when Sim suddenly got up, eyes wide open and started roaming the room. I was like \"were you playing tricks on me?\". It was really miraculous! I couldn't explain it if it's actually normal but I was extremely grateful. I still am today. After the gruesome experience, we went the extra mile to look after him, like looking after a human baby. Brought him a proper food for kitten, took him to the vet when he didn't pee and poo one whole day. As it turns out, he was still too young to pee on his own, so whenever he wanted to pee, he would let out signs which I finally figured out that if when he is meowing but wanted neither food nor milk, I would put him in the shoebox, stimulate him and if he didn't resist, he would proceed to pee until he is done. At first I have mixed feelings about touching an animal at its genitals but after the first time and seeing how at ease he felt, it really made me feel like a momcat. In those six days we took care of him, we were quite surprised that a lot of people were asking for him from this advert. For that, thank you all for your interest, it really meant a lot to us. The morning before we gave him up, I decided to give him a little wash. As I know that all cats hate cold water, I bathed him in warm water and he LOVED it, didn't squirm, didn't kick around, didn't scratch me for putting him in such a spot! At one point, I thought he wanted to immerse himself in the water. Haha! And then I wrapped him up and he fell asleep again before I fed him one last time. Throughout the one hour journey to his new owner, Sim just slept away. We really think that he is so much like a human baby who would fall asleep in car rides because of the aircond and the feeling of the car moving. :) Sim Sim... After handing him over, the new owner has been keeping in touch with us to ask what should she do if Sim is giving certain signs. I felt a bit worried if Sim's signs were misread, and all those sort of stuff a mom would typically be worried of. Text messages from the new owner saying that he likes to climb on top of people and follow them around the house, all the things Sim did to us showed us that he is settled at his new home and his new family. I tell myself that he'll be alright. It's weird that I have kittens at my parents' place but none made me feel like Sim did. None made me feel so emotionally attached like Sim made me feel. Though he might not even know us, what more remember us, we pray that he'll grow happily and healthily. Thank you Sim for the wonderful experience you have given us.\n",

      "He puts up a front and acts mean in front of strangers but in actual fact, is a lovable and well-meaning dog. It all depends on how you approach him. He generally tends to bark at anyone that passes by the house (or if there's a cat or a noisy vehicle) but it's only because he's protective of the masters of the house. He's a well-groomed and active dog that needs a lot of exercise in the morning before you leave the house. If not, he has a nasty habit of chewing anything in sight. If you do intend to adopt him, I think it would be best to channel has energies by enrolling him in agility courses or even guard/watch dog training. He likes to play fetch with a ball and I like setting him loose leash in a safe open space to play and run around with him. He knows the basic commands but is not always obedient and tends to get distracted. Though when it comes to meal times, he will always obey! He needs a firm, stable, cool-headed and knowledgable \"pack leader\" that will give him the EDA (Exercise, Discipline, Affection) that I currently can't afford to give him. If you think you fit the description, please give me call to set up a viewing appointment!\n",

We can arrange a meet-up somewhere public so you can meet her in advance before deciding. Much love, Shakira and Oli ------------------------------------------------------- Hey guys, I have 3 adorable mixed breed female puppies, Shadoh the little black one, Oli and Peanut are white with black patches. They were found motherless and hungry on the streets by a friend. I've had them since 14th Feb (a week now) and will care for them till I find them good homes. They have been de-wormed and vaccinated and I have the vaccination cards as proof. They are not spayed as I don't think it is necessary. I have a 5 year old Golden Retriever that isn't spayed and is perfect, I may spay her in the near future to prevent ovarian cancer. I am leaving the choice up to the adopt-ers. Peanut is a sweetheart, timid, quiet and loves food; Oli is full of energy, curious, loving and very friendly, she was the first to approach my big Retriever; Shadoh is slightly smaller in size, fun and adventurous and also very loving and friendly. Shadoh and Oli always play together and are inseparable so I'm hoping these two could be adopted by one home. But 3 separate homes are more than welcome too. They are all so loving and cheeky. I am HOPING to have them house trained by the time one of you chooses to adopt them. I'm looking for caring dog lovers with families to care for these lil' cuties. I would love to keep them for myself but am leaving the country by the end of March. So PLEASE contact me(calls preferred) if you are interested. We can set up a meeting for you to meet them in person before deciding. Much love, Shakira, Oli, Shadoh and Peanut Bangsar, KL.\n",

Then weird creatures came from above and took me away in some space ship and I was lying down on this table with bright lights. After which when I woke up I felt something was missing between my legs. I'm a hygiene freak. I'd prefer my space to be spotless!! I pee shooting out of the cage unlike Rambo. He thinks he's human he pees in his bowl. I swear! But as for my poop, I still haven't figure a way to shoot that out of my cage yet.But I'd stay away from it. I need lots of space to run coz I have really long legs n huge paws. I need exercise!!! I think with more exercise I'd be able to scare off some thieves with my huge physique.

Alas, we can’t keep as we already have a small dog and our house is not suitable for two. She will mature into a decent sized dog and she can guard the house as she is pretty fierce. We can’t spay her as she is still young( around four months old ). She loves to play and gets excited when she sees us. We have taught her how to sit but, she is still working out on how to shake hands. She is loves dog pellets and craves attention. We would love to find her a home. We can’t keep her and she deserves better than this. If you would like to adopt her we can meet you around Shah Alam and Seremban unless you would like to pick her up yourselves. She needs a home.

      "Tess is an apporximately 1 year old female cat, that tried to move in to our new house before we were even living here full time. She is VERY VERY friendy, including with my 11 year old son. She Loves to cuddle on the couch & also rolls over on her back right away so you can tickle her belly. Tess has a lovely strong tabby stripe, soft fur and a long graceful tail. She likes to prance around and show off. Super easy and litter box trained on her own. She seems to so far only like dry cat food and the occasional chicken meat as a \"treat\". So she is very easy to care for! I would not mind keeping her ....IF I didn't already HAVE 6 rescue cats of my own and also two rescue dogs!! It is simply too much and I will also be moving back to the USA next summer... so I am avoiding adding any more furfriends, that I will then have the huge expense of the move! I hope there is someone who can give this sweet little girl a good home. I would hate to just spay and release her to fend for herself... when she is so friendly, but that is what my choice will have to be, if I can not find a fosterhome or forever home.... instead of giving her to a shelter that might kill her due to overcrowding. :-(\n",

She was staying with a friend who wanted a Belgian and she mixed well with my friend's female German Shepherd. Recently my friend's own German Shepherd delivered a puppy. It was then these two start fighting; maybe because of the GS protective instinct and Jackie's jealousy. I am not sure. I took jackie to my house but I cannot keep her long. I have 2 dogs currently. My house compound is not big for 3 dogs to roam around. If anyone would love to have a Belgian, please contact me. I hope that you are a dog lover and will look after her as your own.

It’s been weeks and there’s still no mother or owner claiming her. She’s quite skittish and afraid of people in the beginning that might be a reaction to how other people have been treating her. Which is why I finally decided to take her home with me. We already have four adult cats and can’t really afford to take in one more. So I hope she can go to a kind and understanding owner that will treat her well. She is a bit love deprived so she loves the attention and meows for you to pet her.

      "Benjie was found loitering at my porch gate 10 days ago. He appeared to be lost and was seriously underfed with his bones showing. His initial appearance lead me to believe he was abandoned near my housing area and somehow found his way to my house by accident. He has a very playful temperament and is ok with small children. No problems with sleeping outside in the porch and he does not bark too much. He understands basic commands like Sit and No. He is also a good guard dog and will bark at strangers at the gate but will stop once ordered to.

He likes to chew things but once given a chew toy no further problems on that. He has a lot of energy and will make a suitable playmate for kids who like to run about. He is quite loving and craves affection. Currently he lives in my porch and is looking for a loving owner.\n",

She is a high energy, bouncy dog, and quite simple in the head in terms of the way she plays. Kyra knows how to SIT, LIE DOWN, and knows how to wait for her meals. She has been treated for heartworm, dewormed, and had extensive treatment for a serious case of demodex. Kyra has NO aggression issues, and I hope to find someone with a big heart and home to take her in.\n",

      "Julie was rescued from the streets and was living in a local animal shelter until recently. Julie is THE puppy you want to adopt if you are looking for a constant companion who never leave your side as she gets very attached to any humans who come close. She loves to explore and very vocal when she is not happy or want to be carried. Active and playful. Annual vaccinations, spaying (to prevent unwanted pregnancy) is a MUST. No caging up or Tying up please.\n",
      "Found this one on the streets yesterday night. She is extremely friendly and tame but I don't think she will last out there, especially since her mommy cat seems to have gone missing for over a week now. Didn't manage to get to her little brother in time and he didn't survive in the neighbourhood so I'm hoping to at least get this one a decent life. I'm currently keeping her with the vet in Puchong, where she will get a full body check up and her vaccination done at the same time. She'll be ready for her second chance in life then, so if you or anyone you know want to take her in, please let me know! Best if she can be kept indoors at all times. 😊 Thanks ya all.\n",

      "I found May (on 6th May ) outside a sundry shop, alone and tiny with no siblings or mum cat around. She was just 3 weeks old. She was totally approachable when I picked her up. Took her to vet for some fungal infection treatment on her back and limbs and dewormed (8th May). She has fully recovered from any skin infections (luckily it was mild) and her fur has fully grown back to shiny black! She eats with a very good appetite and has been fed daily with soft food and now with good set of teeth she's nibbling on kitten kibbles. Was only the length of a TV remote control and now more than doubled up that size! Very playful, super active and adorable kitty. She is roaming freely upstairs/downstairs and everywhere cos she is very disciplined when it comes to her toilet habit and so far has caused no mess. Very clever! She sleeps on my bed at night with my other big cat. Her name came about cos I found her quite late at night in the month of May. Ideally, to go with her lively and playful personality, adopter should already own a kitten or cat to keep her company and to wrestle with and chase around. Adopter who wants to have May must be a good pet owner who provides a loving home environment and healthcare complying to the following pet lover's requirements :- 1) Vaccinations 2) Neutering 3) Lots of TLC! Do text or email me. Thanks for viewing her profile. :D\n",

I am unable to catch her but I have fed her nearly every day. Her puppies are beginning to open their eyes and will be exploring soon. I will try and take more photos but this is difficult as the LRT depot is being built and there are a lot of workmen in the area and Tippy keeps moving her puppies to keep them safe.

      "Introducing Prada-girl and Louis-boy! -------------------------------------------------- ♥ Siblings (male & female), both 7 months old with sleek black coats and floppy ears. ♥ Prada and Louis had a rough start as babies. They were fairly friendly pups who were fostered in only a tiny toilet as their \"home\" (where they ate/slept/poo/pee-ed). They lived for months with almost zero outside world or human contact, and this eventually took a toll on them. ♥ Both siblings were later rescued (with mange, fleas, and all sorts of physical problems). Worse yet, their spirits had been killed and they had little to no trust towards humans. -------------------------------------------------- Good news though!! ♥ Prada and Louis have been under proper foster care and have already made TREMENDOUS progress! ♥ Louis is absolutely friendly (see pics of him below), while Prada is getting extremely curious and edging closer to us day by day. ♥ Prada & Louis are also VERY alert, will bark and make good watch-dogs (not guard-dogs). At other times they have very laid back temperaments. ♥ Both Prada and Louis are looking for understanding and loving new families who can show them the love and life that they lost as puppies, to help them break out of their past endurance entirely. -------------------------------------------------- Please read (Note for Adopters): - Prada and Louis should not be leashed or caged (unless it's for temporary needs). They are a freedom loving puppies. Please drop me a call or email if you feel that you may be just the right person to give either of these darlings a second chance at being loved. Thank you!\n",

One female dog got abandoned here few months ago and she has been here for so long. She stays at my street right in front of my neighbors house. The reason was my neighbors dog made her pregnant and since then she was there with 7 puppies, right in front of the husbands house. I love her but I cannot take her in coz I already have four. That day she almost got caught. So I told myself if she comes back safe from her hiding place I will rescue her. Praise The Lord that she came back safe that evening. I took her in and showered her. My neighbor told me that all her puppies are either dead or got caught. She is now vaccinated, spayed and dewormed. Blood test at the vet also showed healthy status. I need someone to adopt her. Or maybe if you can't adopt just help me to foster her till I find her a new home. I can't release her back on the street as I travel very often for work and I don't want her to be caught when I am not around. Please share this message to ppl you know who wants a dog too. She is very obedient coz I think she had an owner before. She is house trained. I kept her in my living room all this time to separate her from my existing dogs.

      "Blue is an exceptionally warm and fluffy indoor cat. He loves to purr, play and sleep, what cat doesn't. Blue is looking for a new home as his owner is traveling overseas (and taking his four rescue doggies with him). Blues Story: Blue is a very special kitty, and has found a very special place in my heart. He was found at a road side by a friend of mine, a very frail grams of pure will and determination! :) He was in such a state, covered in flees and paint (Blue paint, hence his name!) :) We have no idea how he came to get that way... my friend took him in and patiently and lovingly nursed him back to full health, Blue just didn't give up all the way! :) I adopted him, and now he's here with Missy and Max and he's just full of life, and loves to play and wrestle with Max! Missy is getting used to him to! No matter how much Missy hissed and spat at him, he just didn't give up there either, and persisted to try and make friends with her, it's all working out too, and they now can sniff each other without too much fuss! :)\n",
      "Our rescued dog, Danno Baby is so sweet and I’ll be sad to see him go, but we're moving and can’t take him with us. He’s a gorgeous Golden & white colour, not the usual Mix breed markings and possibly a lab mix. He’s great at guarding the house, smart, attentive and loves playing fetch with you.” He’s wonderfully behaved with men, women, and children, and mostly ignores the cats. Never had a health problem; you can verify with our vet. There is a no adoption fee. Please contact me at , serious offers only. Thanks for your time! :)\n",

      "♥ Male, 6 weeks old, white with cream / brown blotches and blue eyes. Father was a Ragdoll and mother is an American Curl (given up by previous owners while pregnant). ♥ Markus is a wild child! A very playful and energetic boy. A sprinter, loves toys and exploring new things. He enjoys being carried around the house to see things or even outside, however of course he chooses when this happens (not a cuddle-cat while he's playing around). When he's tired or sleeping though - he will seek our arms and is the sweetest thing! He's a nipper and tester of everything so energetic homes or true cat-people will be his best match. ♥ He's already had his first vaccination and deworming. Not fussy about kibble or wet food and is very clever with the litter box! ***IMPORTANT: Note For Potential Adopters*** - Markus must be kept INDOORS at all times. Apartments must be cat-safe. - He's been raised since birth on a grain-free healthy diet and this must be maintained (no Whiskas, Friskies, etc). Feel free to inquire if unsure, this is for any cat's long term well being. - Neutering is COMPULSORY and we will reject anyone who doesn't fit this requirement. There are far too many homeless kittens on the streets. If you feel that you may be just the right person for this boy, please drop me a message with details about yourself and your experience with cats (via WhatsApp or email). Thank you!\n",

      "Caleb is a brave little pup. True to his strong stray lineage, he came charging last Friday afternoon and barked loudly at our three big dogs. That was how little Caleb came into our life. He is a very intelligent and alert pup. He barks along with the pack whenever strangers come to our gate. He is active and trainable. He has learned to poo and pee on the same spot, calling us whenever he needs to do his business when he's locked up in his cage. He is learning to chew only on the 'rag doll' we made for him. He has been vaccinated and dewormed, and he behaved very well at the vet clinic. He doesn't have motion sickness; he was sleek clean in the 1+ hr car ride to the clinic. Overall, he is a quiet, happy, intelligent and brave young chap. Although we have grown fond of Caleb, we would really love to see him living with a loving family. We already have three dogs and three cats - all strays who came our way and nestled with us when they could find no place to call home. If you are an animal lover, and have a room for brave Little Caleb, please contact us.\n",

They are expert climbers and the adopters must welcome exploring kittens climbing all over the house and running up to their shoulders. They have to be adopted together so that they can be BFF and keep each other company when you are at work. They love to play with the kids in the neighbourhood.

He is a very good cat because he is very well in his behaviour and manner. When I say \"no cannot go kitchen\" he will turn back to his original place and lay down.

      "Estee is part of a trio of puppies born to a pair of stray dogs near our house. Her sister was killed by a car a few months ago while her brother suddenly disappeared one day. When we rescued Estee, she was very sick. The vet said she had blood parasite and if we were one day late in rescuing her, she would have died. Estee was put on antibiotics and was in and out of the vet's office for almost 3 months because her condition kept fluctuating. One day she was fine and the next day she will fall sick. We worked hard to make sure she is tick free, flea free and everything free. And we also make sure she eats her food so that she can build up her immune system. Finally in early August , the vet gave Estee a clean bill of health. Estee has, at last, fully recovered from her illness. As long as she doesn't have any ticks, fleas or parasites and she eats proper nutritious meals, the vet said she will be fine. Estee is now a bundle of energy with a real zest for life. Estee is very easy to handle. She is what we call a follower. Estee is a very affectionate puppy and she loves to give her humans kisses. She thrives when she is showered with love and she is not afraid to show her love to us. Estee prefers to do her small business outside but if it is raining or in the middle of the night, she will do it in the potty we provided for her at the car porch. But, she insists on doing her big business outside. At the moment, Estee stands at about 1 foot tall standing on four legs and less than 2 feet in length from the tip of her nose to the tip of her very, very short tail. Estee should be quite small fully grown because her parents are small dogs. Her mother is slightly bigger than a fully grown male cat while her father is only about 1.5 feet in height. Her fur is one glossy black coat. And yes, her ears are as per her picture - one standing upright and the other flopping down. But when she is in alert mode, both ears will be upright. Estee is now learning to bark at strangers that come up to our gate. She will make a good house pet. She is quite good with children too.\n",

      "Hi everyone! My foster mummy's friend found me in a storm drain with my brother and sister when we were less than 2 weeks old. It was raining and we cried for our cat mother but she didn't come. So, mummy's friend climbed into the drain and rescued us. Unfortunately she didn't know how to care for such young kittens so she passed us onto our foster mummy.. We were weak and sickly but mummy tried to keep us alive with bottles of kitten formula and visits to the vet. Sadly, my brother and sister died after two weeks when they caught terrible viruses. I'm the only survivor. Now, I'm strong and old enough to be adopted by someone kind, loving, and responsible. I'm hand-reared so that means i will be a great companion. I'm not afraid of people because they are all i know. Sometimes i think i'm human too. Because i'm hand-reared, i lack some of the skills that other cats have. For example, i do not know how to groom myself properly, the person who adopts me must bathe me and brush my hair every week. I also lack survival skills and i'm not familiar with any of the dangers otuside so i must be an INDOOR cat. My foster mummy could not teach me any normal cat behaviors but I am totally litter-box trained. It would be great if the adopter has another cat, a very patient one, that i can learn from and play with. Here are some details about me: Current diet: Royal Canin Babycat 34 Dewormed: Once, two weeks ago, to be repeated again soon. Litterbox trained: I use the litterbox all the time. Vaccinations and Neutering are COMPULSORY for adoption. Adopter must pay for the vaccinations and neutering. I am an INDOOR cat. NO CAGE CONFINEMENT.

My apologies if the above questions seem to be intrusive or offensive in any way but we are looking for a truly loving and responsible adopter for the felines. All this resulted from our experience in rescuing and rehoming cats. Please note that there is no right or wrong answers as we just wish to learn more about the feline’s potential adopter before making the decision. Thank you. *Please don’t let this put you off as we did not have any prior experience with cats either. It is something that can be learnt gradually over time and it will evolve into a wonderful two way relationship. The important thing is to look at them as a part of our loved ones and not just another animal. Where there is love, relationship and trust will grow.

We used to feed them, everytime we leave, WongWong will escort us to the car, and stood there seeing us off before going to his food. His good manner has won our hearts and we decide to rescue them. Coincidentally, we picked them up the day before the dog shooters came to that area. They are both very loyal and love to be around people. WongWong and YanYan deserve a good home where they can spend the rest of their lives with a loving owner. Both are neutered, vaccinated and in good health. ** TO BE ADOPTED TOGETHER ** If you believe you are the lucky owner, please contact  ( call / whatsapp )\n",

      "Ling Ling (short for Darling) is the most affectionate cat you can have. She sits on your lap in the evenings and place her paw gently on your face, claws retracted (serious!), purring away. Very playful and inquisitive, with big bright eyes and expressive meows whenever you talk to her, Ling Ling makes a great and funny companion. She is easy to pick up as she lets you do it, not like some cats. And she loves the adventure of being underneath the blanket! She also loves climbing into any box you may open. Give her a plastic bag and she'll have a whole night of fun. She's also toilet trained. However, Long Ling is not perfect. She is afraid of strangers at first, but warms up gradually and then becomes affectionate after some time. We have rescued other cats before and she doesn't like them. We think that she might learn to like them if we let those other cats stay longer, but so far we haven't tried. Ling Ling also likes to pull out toilet rolls and tissue paper, so beware!\n",
      "Hope was found in an alley. I rescued him as he was too unique to be an alley cat, plus he was very approachable.

He will surely grow into a most gorgeous cat !!\n",

      "********** NEW Update ********** C’mie, the lost dog from Padang Merbok / Bukit Tunku is now available for adoption. My family and I have been nurturing her back to good health and training her with basic command. Unfortunately we are unable to foster her for an extended duration of time because of our working culture. She has the potential to be a worthy dog, as such I am looking for the best option for her. This shall be a process for adoption, as a friendly reminder, this is NOT a process of buying-selling. Whereby, a second visit shall be considered as conclusive that both of the adopter’s and c’mie criteria fits each other. By the end of this week .. the decision for the adoption will be made. I’m pleased to answer further questions regarding her characteristics and behaviour. As a general overview, she is an energetic, adventurous and fast-learning puppy. At time she is stubborn, vocal (She now has better control of excitement, she is not aggressive) and pleads with you thru the trick of the trade for being a puppy. She behaves well when you are grooming her, if she behaves otherwise, all she needs is time to relax beforehand. She requires a compound and daily walks. Preferably she is adopted by a family with basic knowledge of caring for a dog, a family with children and a family that is inclined for outdoor activities. She would require training to be an obedient dog as she possesses the traits of a dominant dog. Above all else, she reacts best with positive reinforcement. She is more likely to grow bigger but not taller. Her best features is her paws, it is strong and sturdy. Adoption fees RM includes Hills prescription diet I/D (More or less sufficient for July), Ear Drops, Ears Cleaning Fluid, Dog Bowl, Collar (She was found with this collar, would require a bigger collar when she grows bigger) and leash and Dog Bowl. If the adopter does not have a dog cage, I’m willing to provide mine for RM, as it is intended to be donated to the ASPCA. ********** End of Update ********** A puppy with RED collar was found at Padang Merbok. She was wandering about until my group of friends decided to play with her. During the drive to SPCA, it is apparent that she has experience being in the car. SPCA has placed her under the waiting list for adoption. A trip to the vet has confirmed that she has has negative result in both distemper and parvo cvirus. However, she does have an extended stomach as she has not been eating well. Within 2 weeks of regular feeding, it would allow her to return to good health. A treatable physical ailment is that she does have ear mites. Her ears are now cleaned daily coupled with the administration of ear drops. Now that she feels at comfort, it is apparent that she is an intelligent dog that would requires obedience and discipline. She is potentially a good guard dog, respective to the general traits of a German Shepard Dog. She DOES know that there are certain things that would get her into trouble. She will proceed with guilty eyes and plead vocally with you. She chooses to relief herself outdoors, groom herself post-walk. As of yet, there are no listing found for her. Her owner is still being sought after. Due to the extensive working hours during the weekday and marathon training during the weekend, I am unable to foster her for an extended period of time. She would be well suited for an active lifestyle.\n",

      "Found this precious guy at the PAWS shelter in Subang. Marley is a sweet, easy-going dog. He is neutered, dewormed and vaccinated. Seems to be a mini poodle; was quite furry when we got him. He could be a mixed dog, as he is smaller than other poodles, roughly the size of a full-grown shih tzu. To ensure he grows back a healthy coat, we shaved him. Now, his coat is growing back. Unlike most poodle breeds, Marley doesn't get yippy often. He loves to go for long walks and is outdoor potty trained. We are unable to keep him as our apartment doesn't allow dogs and we travel often. He can do a variety of tricks and is smart; seems to be alright by himself as well, even after being left alone. Loves people; but not so much other dogs. Very calm and loving; craves affection. He is perfect for a cuddle when watching tv, which is our favorite activity together besides his twice a day walks. Looking to give him to a wonderful family or couple, preferably in a house where he can run free. Will pitch in a doggy bed, shampoo, some remaining pet food, vaccination card, multi vitamins and ear drops. Serious adopters only please.\n",

      "Sugar and Sago are identical pure white male kittens. It's almost impossible to tell who is who in their picture, hence this 2-in-1 adoption notice. They are part of the 5 kittens born at my place, so it would be preferable if they are adopted with at least one of his brothers/sister, as below: Saffron: Sesame: Sundae: The main difference between Sago and Sugar is their character. Sago is the gung-ho adventurous kitten. He is always the first kitten to pop out of the cage when it's opened. And the first kitten to explore new areas. Sugar will usually stay behind at familiar spots and is more timid. Sometimes Sugar can be identified by his softer tail with a slight curl at the end.

Weighs g on that date. * de-wormed and de-flea treatment on 3 Nov. * eats kitten kibbles, canned food and fresh chicken * litter-box trained Please email or sms and state your name and which kittens you like.

      "These 2 puppies are indeed lucky. They and their 3 other now deceased siblings were notified to us by a NST reporter covering a story in a demolished housing area in Jinjang. This litter of pups & their mum were abandoned when their owner moved out. Not only were they hungry & thirsty; they were covered with red ants all over their tiny bodies.One pup was dead by the time our Photographer cum volunteer arrived. FeiLing quickly brought the remaining 4 straight to one of our supporting veterinary clinics.Inspite of their pain,their hunger took over.Even the weakest ate but it died within hours. The third died the next morning. These two are indeed the lucky ones. We hope you could complete their salvation by giving them a home.They have strengthened and eat like tiny foals;forever playful and are most happy when showered with love. Infact, from their looks & behaviour, I would describe them as Malaysian Jack Russell.\n",

He loves to cuddle and get pet tons, take walks and sit in the park listening to the birds, and playing fetch with people. He is house trained and neutered so there are no messes or embarrassing moments with new lady friends :) He is trained to either go outside for a walk twice a day or pee indoors on a Pet Pad (like a flat diaper on the floor), whichever you get him accostumed to doing. He is very easy to bathe, walk and feed. All this dog needs, besides food twice a day and a bath once a week, is love. If you love him he will love you and be happy. He does not need too much attention or medical care, just love. I am an American teacher in KL. I adopted my Shit Zu, Marley, two years ago from a friend who moved away from KL. Now I am moving away from KL and I want to take Marley to the U.S. However, all snub nosed dogs are banned from airplanes due to the high temperatures, so I cannot take Marley with me!!

They have been treated for mange, fleas, and worms so far. Their skin looks a bit sad in the photos because of the mange. It'll get better in a week or so!

They are all 6 weeks old right now and will be ready to go to their new homes at 8 weeks. The RM50 will be returned to you when you spay/neuter the kittens at 4-6 months. Absolutely NON negotiable! These kittens MUST be sterilized. No exceptions. They must also be vaccinated at the appropriate ages. They are all very friendly and playful. Will not bite or scratch. They have been hand-fed by me, so they are very human oriented. Please e-mail/sms me if you are interested in giving these lovely kitties a new home. Tell me about yourself please, I do not want to receive one line queries asking \"are they still available?\" or \"can I have one?\". These emails will not be entertained.

Riley - She always makes the MOST noise! Especially when she eats. All you hear is *slurpslurpslurp* *nomnomnomnom* It's so cute! She LOVES to eat. She's becoming kind of pudgy too! But she's very playful and adventurous too. Likes to climb everything and play hide and seek/wrestle with the others. Reagan - He's the quiet one. He is a little shy, but he LOVES being picked up and petted. He ALWAYS purrs when I pick him up and he will sit on your lap indefinitely! He just loves being around people and being held. He's such a sweet little kitty. I call him the cuddlebug! Additional info: All the kittens have been socialized with my dog, so they are OK with dogs too (small dogs).\n",

      "Max was bought when he was just a puppy and was bred as a champion pure breed . He's a very active dog and can get very \"manja\" . It is best to have just him instead of having other dogs in the house as his spitz lineage and gender makes him very instinctively dominant . He's groomed regularly at the salon and is a well loved pet . Reason for being put up for adoption : I will be leaving the country soon and do not want to subject him to fly with me as Australia has very strict rules about pets , therefore it will be a long and stressful process for Max to relocate with me . // Interested parties please drop me a whatsapp with a short profile of you , your location and your history with pets . Thank you .\n",

      "Please help me to save these little kittens. there are two of them. 1 female and the other is male. both of them together with the mother are been hanging around in front of my office (in other words there living there). what i'm worried about is that they are very small and in front of my office is a parking lot area and i'm afraid they'll be hit while playing under the car (as you know kittens love to wondering around). some more there also dogs wondering around this area and it is not good for their safety. i think its ok if you just take the kittens without the mother because it seems that the mother started to leave her babies to play by themselves provided you have to feed them as babies i.e with milk to replace the mother's. i cannot keep or adopt them since i'm renting a room in my house and i don't think my house owner gonna like it. so, if somebody out there looking for pets,rather you buy expensive fluffy cats, please help me to save these little kittens because it will mean a lot to them also to me and in the same time you've done something good to the society and the animals. please please please help me to rescue them because i'm afraid the cleaner or the management of this building might done something bad to them because they have started littering everywhere it it cause a very bad smells and i'm afraid people might complain about this. if anyone interested kindly call me at my number ()or please email at . please let me know earlier so that i can keep them and put in the box while waiting for you to come and take them. i provide some of their photos. i know there are not a very fluffy cat or a Persian cats. but i bet they can be a very good friend.\n",
      "Meet Filo, the cute and handsome 6 year old mixed breed boy. Filo is a lucky stray saved by a kind owner earlier this year. This kind owner brought Filo to the vet to treat some external wounds. However, the kind owner has 2 dogs and don't have room for Filo. Filo continues to stay in the cage with the vet from that day till now while his wounds are treated. When the vet is available, Filo gets to go out for a short walk. If the clinic is packed, Filo stays in the cage for the whole day. Its not anybody's fault. Filo is still grateful for this kind owner and the kind vet for their hospitality. But Filo's future is still very uncertain and he is hoping that he's lucky to be granted a permanent loving home. I met Filo when I brought my poodle to visit the clinic. I learn of Filo's story from this kind vet. If you can give Filo a loving home or if you need more information, please call me.\n",

      "Teri was found abandoned in Klang. She has recovered from skin problem on chest and ears due to food allergy. The vets estimated her to be around 1 to 2 years' old. She has done her blood test and the results show that she is generally healthy. Tested negative for heartworm. She weighs about 7 kg (as of October ). We have applied medicated drops on her for heartworm & tick prevention. She is affectionate, playful and friendly (with humans and other dogs). She is either an Australian Terrier or a Terrier Mix. She barks excitedly when she wants to play or when meals are served. Therefore, she's probably not suitable to stay in apartment. She barks at strangers at the gate, too. If you can provide her with a loving home (no cages or unnecessary tie-up), please drop us a message and give us a brief description of her future home. Note: Serious adopters only. You must be prepared to commit for the rest of her life, feeding reasonably good food, keep her vaccination, deworming, heartworm prevention up-to-date, allow her to exercise, and be prepared to spend on medical bill in the event that she falls sick.

      "A couple weeks ago two kittens were found by my aunt's colleague in her car engine compartment. She wasn't sure when the kittens were placed there, but she knew the poor kittens had at least traveled one journey in there, probably traumatized beyond belief. Since the lady did not know how long the kittens were there, she could not know where they came from and where their mother is, and this is when my aunt called me for help. I named them Nobu (the white one) and Yoshi (the orange one) after Japanese warlords Nobunaga and Hideyoshi. Strong names for two strong boys. Nobu had an eye infection at the time of rescue, but had cleared up now with eye ointment. Both kittens had also been dewormed at the same time. They are currently about 1.5 months old to be accurate. I had successfully weaned them off milk, and they can eat kibbles on their own now. (RC baby kitten) Though they do still enjoy milk on the occasion. They are litter trained, though can still get messy at times kicking litter all over. Yoshi the orange tabby is the older brother, the bigger of the two. He has the CUTEST round eyes and can be quite manja. He is more mild mannered compared to Nobu, but is a fast learner. He purrs loudly. Nobu is the younger one but he is also the adventurous one. He is extremely curious and likes to explore wherever he can get to via whatever method he can. (jump, climb etc) However, he can be a bit messy, spilling kibbles all over, getting milk beards, stepping into the water bowl etc. He has a super cute 'mew' though! Both kittens are extremely playful, Yoshi especially LOVES to play with feathers. They can also be potential lap cats. I used to bottle feed milk to them on my lap sitting on a small stool, even though I don't now since they broke their milk bottle, sometimes they still like to climb onto my lap and I'll pet them. ******SERIOUS ADOPTERS ONLY****** - It would be most preferable if they can be adopted together, I don't want to split the two brothers since they are quite attached to each other. - They must be spayed at the age of 6-8 months. - The brothers must be kept INDOORS since they do not grow up on the streets and are not street smart. If interested, please e-mail me or SMS/Whatsapp me at. Please do not call!\n",

      "My two little kittens are very healthy and like most kittens that age, very playful too. I found them about a month ago (8/7) when I was out on my run near my house and they just appeared out of nowhere from an abandoned house. They looked really scared and hungry and was as if pleading with me to help them; didn't want to let me go and kept following me. So I took them home and they have been under my care ever since. Unfortunately I cant keep them (as much as I would have loved to) as a family member is allergic. They're fed only with special cat food and they have very good appetite. I'm not sure of their exact age but I'm guessing they might probably be around 3-4 months and they're both female, and I presume they're siblings. I would prefer that they find a proper home and if possible, they stay together. Hate to see them separated! Please adopt them! You are most welcome to come over to visit them.\n",

      "Snowy Girl's mama is a mixed Terrier. They were rescued from an irresponsible breeders who force mama Snowy to breed for their greed to sell off the puppies at a pasar malam. Mama Snowy is now adopted by a super nice woman who loves her to bits! Now Snowy Girl is looking for her forever home. Her wish is simple - she just wants someone to love her. Besides feeding her, playing w her, walking her, bathe her etc etc etc hahaaa Anyways, Snowy Girl is one happy playful puppy. She has a very shaggy fur on top but just like her mom, I think it is due to lack of nutrition coz those irresponsible people didn't feed them with good food. Heck, they only fed them once every alternate days!!!!! Oh, let's get back to the fur part. Her fur is quite shaggy on top and on her sides, it looks like its been trimmed nicely but that is how her fur grows. Very special indeed. She will grow to be medium size but quite leggy coz mama Snowy is quite leggy too. Snowy Girl is great w children and is full of love and smiles. If you have a household of other dogs, no worries, Snowy Girl gets along well w other dogs too. As long as your current fur-babies are friendly. If you think she is the one your family is looking for, give me a buzz. Only for serious adopter please. ADOPTED ON 24TH FEB TO DEON\n",

So Nicole Suresh﻿ and I headed over there as soon as we could and picked her up. We gave her a quick bath as she had quite a few ticks and thankfully we managed to get a foster carer for her who will be looking after her until she is ready for adoption. We have decided to call her Dakota as she is so friendly, and the name Dakota literally means friend. She's also very good with other dogs and got along with the foster carer's dogs immediately. We have just dewormed her and she's going for a check up tomorrow. She will be vaccinated after a week or two as we need to make sure that she hasn't got any underlying health problems. Please SMS or WhatsApp or if you can give this sweetie a good and loving home that she deserves. ******************** TERMS & CONDITIONS FOR ADOPTION 1.

      "Dhani : Male, Neutered Approx. 10 months old Dimsum : Male, Not-neutered Approx. 5 months old Both are vaccinated, litter-trained & indoor cats. Dhani was a stray that I used to feed at where I'm staying. I brought him back on 7th Nov after the management published a notice about complaints on animals in the compound. After less than a week under my care, Dhani fell from his bedroom window (5th floor) & broke his left leg very bad that it had to be amputated. Even with only 3 legs, Dhani is like a normal cat; manja, very active cat, likes to run around & plays a lot with other cats especially with Dimsum. Dimsum was rescued from a busy road in Klang on 3rd Dec . He gets along with most of other cats & is also very active. He likes to hang out with Dhani most of the time. Both are very playful. Dhani likes boxes & Dimsum likes to play fetch with his mouse toy. Potential adopters are encouraged to adopt both of them as they are very close with each other. And must also ensure that Dimsum will be neutered once he reach 6 months old.\n",

      "Josie was rescued from my mechanic’s workshop because she is at high risk of being run over by vehicles there, stepped on by the people coming and going there, plus exposed to heavy metals, chemical fumes and heavy machinery. My mechanic was the one who first rescued her though, so I thought I’d help him find her a good home as I'm usually not at home. In addition, I am partially allergic to pet dander, which is a skin rash condition that flares up if exposure is prolonged. I would love to give her hugs because she is an intelligent and loving baby but my condition requires me to limit physical contact. Josie is also already weaned, now eating Iskhan (holistic Korean) kitten kibbles and also wet canned food. Playful, smart, affectionate, sweet natured and active, she will be ready for adoption once she is dewormed and vaccinated. Potential adopters may contact me at (voice calls only) or at via SMS and whatsapp. I’m located in KL but meet-ups can be arranged in most PJ, KL and Melaka city areas. All pre-adoption/fostering costs will be borne by myself. Pre-adoption/Fostering costs covered include : Deworming, vaccination, Advocate, de-flea/de-ticking and flu medication.

      "I found Scratch under my BBQ pit in my car porch and she stole my heart. Weak and abandoned, she seemed so helpless. While I've never owned a cat, I was won over and decided to take her in. Unfortunately, changes at work means I won't be around to look after her. Heartbroken to see her go but I'd like her to have a good permanent home. Scratch was 2+ months old when I found her. She has had her first vaccination and deworm pill done. She's also potty trained. A month on she is growing fast! Smart, active and playful, her favourite toys are my Ipad charger (forget Appstore, she has more fun trying to chase it around), a stressball (I feel more destressed seeing her play with it then when I actually squeeze it myself) and a little piece of cloth which I used to cover her when she first came in (I guess it is her security blanket). Vet/Owners at the petstore I brought her to were very attracted to her so hoping she will appeal to one of you kind souls. Hoping to find a new owner by Tuesday, 11th June.\n",

      "Rex was an abandoned and we believe abused dog that was rescued by a client from an area close to her workplace. The rescuer had seeked our services in bringing Rex personally to the clinic for treatment and to be boarded. He has been boarded in the clinic since March and is looking for a loving home. Efforts are being made to make this happen for Rex. Rex needs someone who will patiently want to know him for who he is. Rex loves to play fetch and he loves to gnaw on his chew bone. He loves them dental treats too :) A perfect guard dog because this boy is alert at all times, forget tip toeing away because he notices everything! Once he builds his trust in you, you could certainly find a loyal friend in him. His favourite past time is to sit and watch the world go by with you. Honesty is the best policy and these are my thoughts - Boarding is part of the services provided but it isn't the main function. If I'm lucky during my working hours, I could spend up to an hour plus with him but those days are harder to come by. Otherwise its after my working hours / when I'm off / working half day. His walks are only limited to the clinic's back lane and his view of the world is decreasing as months pass by in my opinion. Picture this, put ourselves in his shoes, who likes the same old mundane view and then its back to being caged the rest of the time and the cycle repeats? I get it that the rescuer is financing his stay but one must be realistic. I just don't think its healthy for Rex or any animal per say to be boarded for a long time, and in Rex's case, is he still going to be boarded until the end of the year? Next year? Look into his eyes..tell me you don't see what I see? There is a story there..All he needs is someone who is willing to decode it. His eyes do look sad to me too, its like as though he is crying out and wondering is this what his life is going to be like? Rescuing an animal is one thing but you also have to think about the animal's wellbeing too since he has been here since March! Its not about the money, its about his happiness. Other animals they come and go and Rex? He is just here. Its heartbreaking to see his life at a standstill like this. Just awaiting for someone to adopt him and the wait has extended for months and months. I do feel it a lot since I am the one who has the most contact with him. If I hadn't vigorously started getting the word out about Rex, no one would have really heard about him. The rescuer has never once visited him, nor was there any posters or flyers made on her part to be distributed. The last time she had asked about Rex was ages ago. If human beings could get depression, animals could too. Please introduce yourself by calling / e-mailing / dropping by the clinic if you want to give Rex a chance to be himself again.. Sincerely, Yasmin Kristy's Ark Senior Assistant\n",

      "Hello, my name is blessing. I had a very hard life. I had an accident several months ago , my right front leg was badly injured, I had to drag my leg when I walked. Later, it became infectious. The pain was unbearable. Everywhere I went, people despised me. Then I found a place at a parking lot in a big condo where I could hide and rest. A lady who lives there noticed me while on her way to work. She was kind to me. As days passed, I began to trust her. One day I threw myself in front of her car and blocked it. I did not move till she came down and saw my condition. She called for her sons and one of her friends for help but i only trusted her, she put a leash on me and sent me to a nearby clinic. By then my leg was badly damaged , the vet had to amputate my front leg. After one week, i was discharged from the clinic but the lady dose not have any place to keep me so she asked somebody for help. My picture was posted up in facebook and lots of good-hearted people called and offered to foster me till I recover. Now I'm fully recovered and in need of a forever loving home. I am a very sweet girl , cheerful and playful dog. Please give me a chance to have a good life. Thank you.\n",

They are 4 months old and not vaccinated,dewormed only. The 4 kittens are able to eat both wet food and dry kibbles. They're also litter trained.

      "Two months ago, I found three abandoned kittens in a small box on the side of the road. They were only a month old and were quite helpless. I had to buy formula and we bottle fed them. One of them was adopted by my friend but I don’t know anyone else personally who can take the other two. Now, two months on, they are very playful, active, and extremely friendly. They love human company and will purr when you pick them up. I can’t keep them because my cat isn’t used to other cats and gets stressed out by them. I insist that whoever adopts them will spay them when the time comes and gets all the proper vaccinations and deworms them regularly. If possible, I would also like the adopter to take both. If not, it would be good if the adopter already has another cat that is friendly as I feel they may get lonely without other cats for company since they’re not used to it.Gertrude has a small white patch on her forehead while Cake has a completely black forehead. They do not recognize their names so the adopter can choose new names.\n",

      "This lady cat has a sad story. She was in a family, being well taken care of. Then, her family left Malaysia… and dropped her in our condo garage. She has been surviving there for approximately 2 years, having 4 litters. Thanks to a lot of patience, we managed to get closer, feeding her and giving her some cuddles. Last week, I finally managed to catch her to get her neutered and vaccinated. She must be around 3 or 4 years old. She is a tokinese mix breed. She has beautiful green eyes, and a black-brown fur. She is litter trained. She would need a family that has experience with cats and a lot of patience. She had to learn to survive the hard way and she is now quite suspicious of humans. But, she has shown a lot of love to us which brought the decision to try to find a family for her, to avoid releasing her. We are going to keep her one more week to give her the time to heal properly. If we found no takers by Sunday, she will be released. We are putting a lot of time and money to save the cats around our condo. To that extend, we are only considering the family who are doing no caging. Having been in the streets, she will not bear to be caged, even for the night. Moreover, we want a family that will keep her indoors at the beginning, the time that she is learning back to be a domestic cat. She will need your love and your patience in order to feel secure again. If you want to give her a new start in life, please contact me before Sunday the 22nd (April).\n",

      "I found this kitten yesterday near a drain covered with big red ants. It is underweight (weighs about gm) and is as big as my palm. Tried to feed it with kitten tuna, kitten biscuits, cat milk and water but it refused to eat or open its mouth. Took it to the vet. Vet found 2 big reds ant in its anus. Also another ant hooked on its body. It's literally in bones. Doc says he's around 6-7 weeks (judging from the teeth) but size of about 4-5 weeks. After a check-up, doc said it's intestines are very hard like rubber and filled with gas. Probably it's not been eating and defecating for some time. Its body is also infested with fleas. Doc also found out its hind legs were filled with pus, due to an injury. Doc said he'll get it cleaned up and treated. I'm looking for a foster home or adopter who can give this kitten a chance to live. Thank you. Update (/): Sky has recovered well. She's with a temporary foster and is looking for a permanent & loving home. She eats well and is active.\n",

In front of Wisma Tractors, I noticed a black velvety furry ball by the side of the road as many cars were driving past. As I got closer I saw 2 twinkling lights from the furry ball. I quickly did a U turn and crossed the road to find it was this little kitten, shivering in fright but not running. It was just lying 6 inches away from the wheel of passing cars. I picked it up and took it to my car. The kitten was very afraid of the vet and wet itself and started hissing in fear, but it was fine when I picked it up. The vet said one leg is broken and needs complete rest for 1 month. As my home was under renovation I could not take it home, so it has been looked after by the vet for 6 weeks now and I will pay them. It’s now time for it to have a home and has lost weight because it doesn’t like being caged. It is a very well behaved kitten. I have named it “Little One” and its coat was like Mink with slightly longish fur. Please Give “Little One” a home. Contact Hema.\n",

      "Update on the 18th of October: Parsley has grow up quite a bit during the last few weeks. He had long fur before, but his fur hasn't grown any longer since; so I need to reclassify him as domestic medium hair now, not domestic long hair. He had marbled speckled green eyes, but they have changed to a green/yellow color, and are less specked. Parsley loves playing with other cats; he likes to play on his own as well. He'll find a comfortable place to sleep when he's tired. Parsley has a good appetite and doesn't meow much--only when he's hungry. I've also de-wormed him today. I fostered Parsley from SPCA. He has a cotton soft coat, speckled eyes, and a short tail. He is the boss when eating; he hits the bowl with his paw and stares at other cats who're sharing food with him. All the cats, including my own, stop when he does that (he doesn't bite or scratch though). What is funny is that he always gets beaten up by other cats when playing. He learns fast: When he meows too much and I shush him he goes quite, then he looks like he's meowing, but with very little sound. That's sweet. Parsley is playful. I'm currently feeding Orijen to Pasley; I feed it to all my cats these days. I used to feed my own cats Royal Canin Hair & Skin, but after I realised it wasn't the best quality food I changed to Origen straight away. I was feeding my rescued cats Acana, but switched to Origen when I found that Acana was often out of stock. I also give cats mineral water/filtered water as I don't like to give them tap water; it's got too many chemicals like chlorine etc. The adopter has to agree to bring Parsley back to me to be neutered around mid January next year. I will pay the neutering fee. Neutering/spaying cats can reduce the number of strays. Many cats get killed everyday by accidents, humans, or dogs. Unneutered males can get many females pregnant during the mating season, so please support neutering/spaying to save lives All the adoption fees will go to trapping and neutering/spaying other strays. The cats I catch will either be returned to nature (TNR), or their photos will be put on PetFinder to be re-homed. A cat's average life is years, but some live up to 20 years if they are well looked after. It is a commitment if you want to have a pet cat. Please DO NOT dump them if they are not cute anymore; they have feelings as well, just like we do. Please give me a ring or sms if you are interested. Thank you. Here is a bit of information about cat food: Cats can't tolerate corn and wheat; they cause cats a lot of health problems. The common brands of cat food--such as Friskies, Smartheart, and Whiskers--contain a lot of these ingredients and are awfully bad for cats. Corn and wheat are just used because they are cheap, but they have no benefit for cats. Well known premium brands, like Royal Canin and Science Plan, also contain corn/maize. I'm unhappy with these companies because their products are pricey, but the quality isn't excellent to match! There are a few other brands that are better quality and don't contain corn and wheat, but at a similar price to Royal Canin and Science Plan: Orijen, Acana, Natural Balance, Evo and Feline Caviar(Holistic) all have 0% corn and wheat and are much better quality.\n",

      "Minnie is found loitering at a nearby kopitiam in Sg Buloh one morning nearby where i'm working and sensing she could be abandoned as there was no adult dogs or other pups nearby, she was extremely hungry and thirsty too as she gulped down the kibbles and water that i have in my car when feeding it to her. She was nearly run down by a vehicles while i had my breakfast and since it is not safe for her to be on the street i decided to foster her while looking for potential adopter. She is very playful and at a stage where she like to chew and bite on stuff so the adopter needs to train her and be patient, all puppiesd are cute but requires a lot of patience and discipline but rest assured once they have matured they will learn to be more docile but the adopter plays a major role in this. A minimum fee of RM is needed for her spaying/neutering operation when she is 6 months old to prevent future pregnancies and diseases such as uterus cancer, so please bear in mind the adoption fee is mainly used for Minnie's operation and welfare. As long as the adopter takes on the responsibility to care for Minnie's welfare throughout, i'll be more than happy so please give her a forever home today!\n",

      "Hi! My name is Melody. I am about 4 months old. I was born in the bushes somewhere in Sri Petaling on the 9th September . I was sent to PAWS Mission shelter in early November and was fostered shortly after that by Richard. When Richard took me home, I was quite sick and was quickly taken to the Vet clinic where I was diagnosed with tick fever and put on blood transfusion immediately. I had to stay overnight at the clinic, which terrified me. I remember the vet telling Richard that I was whining a fair bit in my cage. After a few more vet visits and with lots of medication (yuckkhh!!) and supplements, I feel much, much better now. That was 2 months ago. I now have a very healthy appetite and weigh about 6.5 kg. Richard has been feeding me kibbles (with cod liver oil & supplement topping), canned food and rice cooked with liver and chicken(yummy!!). I also get those occasional treats when I'm able to follow some simple instructions like sit and shake hands (Shhh - don’t tell anyone but I am only doing this so that I can get the goodies ). I'm also very energetic now and enjoy running around in the yard and playing fetch the ball/bone/tree branch with Richard. I was vaccinated on 20th December after given a clean bill of health by the vet. As Richard is unable to look after me permanently :(, I am looking to be part of a loving new family :). I am very affectionate, intelligent and loyal – I won’t try to leave home. Like most puppies though, I occasionally love shoes & slippers, digging dirt to bury my goodies and playfully nip Richard’s hand (he knows I’m just playing with him). I am still maturing and like human kids need to be shown where my boundaries are. If you like my story and would like to adopt me as part of your family, please call Mrs. Lai at or Richard at .

      "Adoption fee includes the basic medical expenses of the animal : spaying + 3 vaccinations. We at first thought that Picasso is a male (oops ;p we're not good in identifying sex of kittens) and so we gave a male name. But in fact Picasso really looked like a boy when she were young - she was aggressive when playing, always love to disturb the other cats & acts in a boyish way. Picasso was being rescued from roadside several months ago, we saw that there's a man stood there kept trying to kick Picasso away, she was just a tiny baby asking for foods that time! We sent her to vet for medical check up and found that she got real severe virus infection on stomach and she had diarrhea for over 2 weeks even after she took medications. Picasso is a big and healthy girl now and she started to really look like a girl..she's independent, smart, active and always love to play with her toys & friends. She loves to play different kind of toys and will never let you down when you get her a new toy - she will play it smartly in front of you. She do not like to be carried or hugged, but sometimes she will be very manja, she will just sit beside you and ask for your love and a pat on head. Please give a home to Picasso ♥\n",

      "Hi all, About 5 days ago, a stray female cat gave birth at my neighbour's. For some reason, she (the female cat) decided to move her kittens to my place. When i found her, she was hiding in my shoe rack, so, i made them a place to stay; a box, with an old towel, a bowl of water and some kitten food. It was ok for the first 3 days. On the 4th day i noticed the female cat is away for a longer period than usual. As i was away yesterday, i told my brother to keep a lookout for the female cat and it seems she hasnt returned since last night. They have been crying for quite a while and I think they're just hungry. In the mean time, we're taking care of these kittens, feeding it with milk replacement. Appreciate if some kind soul out there would adopt/foster these kittens, preferably someone with a mother cat who just gave birth and wouldnt mind additional members to the family. Update (): Coco and Spotty are on milk replacement diet. Took them to the vet,they're putting on weight which means they're healthy and they are also in good shape. Require utmost care and attention.\n",

Currently looking for a HOME for this lovely beautiful doggie whom we have named HARRY. Harry is rather active as the vet and groomer says he looks like he is less that 2 yrs old. Initially Harry was rather fierce. This could be due to self survival as he must have been abandoned to some months.

      "Sweet little Angel was born without eyes. His owner although devastated never gave up on him. She provided everything she could so Angel can have a chance to live a normal life. Many would believe a dog born with such disabilities should be put to sleep. As the owner is working and fearing Angel may hurt herself, he is currently living in a cage 24 hours a day. The owner would like Angel to have a normal life running and playing around just like other dogs. We are now looking for a loving home for little Angel. It's our hope to find a owner who accept him with this disabilities and love him unconditionally so he can live life to the fullest. Our recommendation to potential adopters : a) Ask yourself the following questions : - Am I ready to be the owner of a blind dog. - Did I have the commitment needed? - Did I have the knowledge? - Did I have the right conditions in my home? - Most importantly, did I have the love in my heart to raise this dog? b) Allocate time so both yourself and Angel can understand each other. c) Provide time for training so Angel can recognise sounds. If you believe you can raise Angel and in return inspired others to care/raise blind puppies, please contact me for further details. “Blind Dogs See With Their Heart and Are Worth Loving”.\n",

      "Blue approached me in my backstreet asking for food. I noticed he had difficulty eating. The vet found that he had badly infected teeth and gums. Pus was coming out of his mouth as he tried to eat. He was successfully treated with antibiotics and all his teeth saved. However, he tested positive for FIV. I am reluctant to release him back to the street as his health needs close monitoring. Blue is a highly socialised and affectionate cat. It is likely he once had a home. With proper nutrition and care, Blue can grow up to be a beautiful and healthy cat. I believe he deserves a good and safe home with a loving owner. Please consider giving Blue a home. Thank you.\n",

      "This pooch earned his name by serenading one of our female dogs outside the gate with yelps and kisses! He was noticably dirty and underweight. His previous owners had cut his nails so short that there was almost nothing left, which would have caused him unimaginable pain. Despite the ordeal, he craved human contact and responded well to pats. When nobody came to claim him, we took him in. A trip to the vet confirmed that he had an advanced case of heartworm but, after treatment and plenty of TLC, he is rapidly gaining weight and is as good as new.\n",

      "Princess is the last survivor of 5-6 puppies dumped by an irresponsible person behind a restaurant close to my residence when about 1 month old and left to scavenge from the drain. There were only 2 remaining when I tried to get them adopted through Petfinder but failed for months as they were highly afraid of humans and fled into an opening whenever I tried to get closer, probably due to the constant abuse, threats and beatings from the restaurant workers. I could always hear them crying out in pain/fear from my home. Sadly I believe her brother was bludgeoned to death. There was nothing I could do until one day during a heavy downpour which flooded her place of refuge, I found her at my doorstep. We have been fostering her and can finally post her up for adoption after 2 weeks of getting her to trust and adapt to humans. She is still cautious and slightly fearful but we managed to give her a bath and continue building her confidence. Hope to find her a good home soon so she can be loved and cared for. She's smart and cheerful too and I'm sure you will enjoy having her as part of your family. Update (9th-July-15): ============= We got her vaccinated, dewormed & neutered so she has a better chance of being adopted. She has since adapted well with humans and loves attention.

      "Hi everyone! My name is Theo and i'm about 3 weeks old now. My auntie Rebecca rescued me on monday 15 June . She found me behind her house surrounded by dogs!! She quickly picked me up and brought me inside her house. Sadly auntie Rebecca is busy fostering 5 pups and their mum so she called my new foster mummy Lynette for help. When i arrived at mummy Lyn's house she was amazed by how chubby and healthy i looked!! She says i'm so cute that i make her eyes hurt!! I'm not weaned yet so mummy Lyn still has to feed me kitty milk. I really hate the milk bottle so i have to be syringe fed for now. I hope my teeth grow soon so I can start eating yummy canned kitten food and kibble! Mummy Lyn wants to keep me forever but she can't coz she has soooo many pets now. I hope someone will adopt me and love me like she does. I should be able to go to my new home in about 3 weeks, once i am completely weaned and litter trained. Mummy lyn wants me to be healthy, so my new parents will have to pay for my vaccinations and they must neuter me because there are already too many homeless hungry kittens like me struggling in the streets and suffering.. For adoption to a safe and loving home. INDOOR only. Vaccinations and neutering are COMPULSORY. NO CAGE CONFINEMENT. Adoption procedure: - Set up a meeting with me and Theo. - See if potential adopter and Theo are suitable for each other. I will ask a lot of questions to make sure adopter is suitable. - Succesful adopter will then have to meet us at my vet in order to get Theo vaccinated before being able to take Theo home. Cost of vaccination and neutering to be borne by adopter. - I will make a home visit. - Adopter may have to provide me with occasional updates. Interested parties can call, sms, or email me. Serious enquiries only please. A description of yourself and your experience with cats is greatly appreciated. UPDATE 24 June - Theo has learned how to do his business in the litter box and started eating canned kitten food on his own yesterday!!\n",

She absolutely loves to be petted but when your petting her she will make all sorts of funny and weird little chirping sounds.

She is shy of new people and takes a while to warm up to strangers. Having said that once she knows you she will smoother you with cuteness. I know Callie is an older cat but just because she isn't under 6 months old doesn't mean anything. She is still as playful, loving and cute once you get to know her.

After falling very ill with tick fever and being attacked and mauled by the strays in the area, Stan and his wife decided she had to get of the streets. I am fostering Lassie and she has been with me for about 2 months. She loves other dogs and will have no trouble going to a family with other dogs. She will chase nervous cats but does not hurt them. Confident cats who stand their ground get their due respect. She is beautiful; I think a cross between Border Collie and Labrador. She learns fast and is eager to please. She is calm indoors but can walk and run for hours if you're the active type. She may knock small children over with her enthusiasm but there isn't an ounce of malice in her and this will subside with age. Moreover she prefers to snuggle up and nap with her people.

(English version below) 第一次见到我，你可能会觉得我有点害羞，但我非常喜欢亲近人。所以很多附近的上班族都会来陪我玩耍，喂我吃东西。我曾经有过很多一起陪伴我流浪的同伴。但是在生活条件艰难的情况下，现在只剩下我一个。我年纪大，皮肤也不比其他狗好看。而这些都是流浪的日子在我身上留下的痕迹。如果你愿意接受我的不完美，我也会忠心的陪着你。期待我可以结束流浪在外的日子，可以有个家。 You may think i am a shy & timid dog when you first meet me, but i can turn into a very friendly & manja dog after making friend with you. I used to have a accompany (dog friend) few months back. But now i am left alone due to bad living conditions. I am old with wrinkled skin and these are all signs for years of straying. If you willing to accept imperfections in me, i will be your loyal friend for life. I am looking for a beloved human family to adopt me and put an end to my straying life.\n",

The situation demands urgency for as mentioned, it is currently boarding at the vet's.

      "Mr Fluffers and Cocochino were rescued from the streets of my neighborhood with their mother and sister a few months ago. They are two little beauties with the smoothest, glossiest fur i have ever touched. These brothers are extremely close and I want them to be ADOPTED TOGETHER. Mr fluffers is the leader of the two as he is more daring, outgoing, and openly affectionate. Cocochino harbors some fear of strangers and it took him a long time to warm up to me. He follows what his brother does all the time. So, when he sees that fluffers and i are having fun together, he loosens up and joins in. He loses his fear when he is together with fluffers, separate them and his fears return. If you are looking for INDOOR cats and don't mind their high energy play, you can call me at . Adopter must be a very patient person as Cocochino will not be immediately friendly, must be willing to put in effort to build a relationship with these boys, a true cat lover. The succesful adopter will have to reimburse me for Mr Fluffers and Cocochino's neutering and vaccinations at which point i will hand over their medical booklets. This means the adopter must pay me back for what i have spent on their neutering and vaccinations. I don't make a profit. They have received their first and second vaccinations. Diet: Acana Kitten kibble, Natural Balance canned food. Litter trained: Use the litter box without fail. Grooming: Because they've got pretty long hair, they may need occasional grooming. Neutered: /08\n",
      "active kitten. still menyusu. litterbox trained. diet: ProDiet(dry food) would be happier if adopted :)\n",

      "The long and short of it is, we recently took home a cat from our carpark to see if we could find her owner only to realize a few weeks later that she was pregnant. 2 months later and by the miracle of life, 5 (3 females, 2 males) kittens now roam my living room. Sadly we don't have the time to look after all of them so we are looking for new families that can give them the attention they each deserve. Would love if someone was interested in taking them in pairs to make the separation easier.\n",

      "My incredibly handsome cat whose name is Tiger recently got neutered, he is friendly and loves to eat. Tiger's bestfriend, Simba is pampered and likes attention. However, she has not been neutered. It all started with a stray cat that keeps coming for food, she soon after gave birth at our house and started her own family generation. Simba's mother on the other hand, was a kitten when I found her at my backyard. My house currently has 11 cats, 5 of which are newborn kittens. We love cats but it's too much for us to handle as we have other responsibilities to attend to. Looking for anyone who is keen to adopt our adorable cats and take good care of them.

The Puppy is very adorable, friendly and loving. Mandy doesn't bark much unlike other dogs, she would only bark 1 or 2 times and not so loud when she is being played with (Excited). She is in perfect health condition. Very active and has good appetite (both table or dog food). She has been dewormed, no more flees (we managed to remove ticks from her some time ago with her shampoo). The dog is clean and no wound. She is hugable (no strong smell).

When he first settled into our shed, he was emaciated and forlorn looking. From what we know, he, along with his 20 fellow canine friends were enclosed in a compound without food for quite sometime.

      "Chance was rescued by my housemate from a hit and run near our house a few months ago. Our neighbours and friends chipped in for his treatment, and after a few months in the vet he's now up and about, and staying with us for the time being, until we find him a loving home. My housemates and I love him a lot, but unfortunately we won't be able to keep him as the three of us are not always home, and we aren't sure how long we'll be staying in this house. Chance is still young, the vet said at most 1.5 years. He is full of energy, but reasonably well behaved. A common friend of ours who is a dog-owner showed my housemates and I how to care for him. We take him for walks and/or runs daily - which is great because we get to exercise too! He's great company - generally listens and follows us when we walk, and does not bark at other dogs in houses we pass by. He's tries to make friends with cats and other dogs we meet on walks, but he's not always very lucky. Chance is a wonderful dog. As long as his energy is channeled regularly into positive activity, he will be very well behaved. He has misbehaved before, he chewed up my housemate's slippers and my bicycle pedals - but that's only because we forgot to take him out that day and he was bored out of his wits staying home alone. We haven't taught him any tricks, but he knows that whenever he sits down / calms down, good things may happen (i.e. go for walks, runs, gets more petting etc) - we try our best to encourage good behavior with treats or toys (tennis ball, stick, chewed up slipper etc), and we try our best to curb bad behavior either by ignoring it or staying away, or a pat on the bum with rolled up newspaper. We have about a quarter of a 20kg bag of dog food, treats, a leash, a chain, water and food bowl to give away as well. We just want Chance to find a loving home where he can be happy.\n",

      "ONLY FOR KLANG VALLEY Fluffy is looking for a new home. Her current owner is pregnant and cant care for her anymore. She was adopted recently so owner doesn't have much details about her background. Once she is settled in, she does know how to do her toilet during walks. She is afraid of big dogs but ok with small breed dogs. Generally easygoing girl. No caging or tying her up. Adopter will have to pay for her neutering. We hope she will be able to find a loving owner who can give her the best care. Please call if you can give her a good home.\n",

      "We found Har-nee with a swollen and almost severed paw. We sent it to the vet and crowd-funded her amptutation. Her front left leg is amputated up to the thighs. She is recovering well from surgery and can move freely with three legs. She is extremely tame and friendly, and would wag her tail like a pendulum to anyone who's nice to her. Like most strays, she does not poop or pee in the house compound and will only do so when you take her out for a walk. We really wish that we could keep her but we are all students who live away from home. Right now we are rotating her between different houses to avoid getting caught by landlords. We definitely don't want to put her back on the streets so if you are looking for a dog, please consider giving her a chance.

      "Date found: Wednesday, 24 March Time: 6.00 pm Breed: American Cocker Spaniel Sex: Bitch Age: Judging by her teeth, 3-5 years old. Place Found: Bandar Sungai Long Characteristics: Brown, short furred, had a flea collar and choke chain around her. No visible disease, just starved. Had her frontline-d today. Groomed, and checked by the vet. Free from any visible diseases except for a mild skin condition and severely underfed. Have checked with Vets and pet stores around the area but have failed to find a match. After just one day, she is regaining her appetite and is doing well. Potty trained, and would only do her business outside. Unfortunately I cannot keep her, she is currently boarding at the kind-hearted groomers till today for free. If by today there are no fosterers or adopters, she will be sent to SPCA :( I have tried posting this in numerous sites, but sadly have gotten no results. I'd decided to name her \"megan\" for now. Megan is obedient and caring, well tempered and perfect for a small family. For more info check out: If you are interested please CALL ME IMMEDIATELY at. UPDATE: Due to the numerous amounts of calls regarding breeding Megan. I shall have two conditions for adoption. 1. Megan MUST be spayed. Spaying costs are to be shared equally. 2. I get to check on Megan at least twice a year (for the sake of her well-being).\n",

      "Introducing dashing little Maksim! ♥ Male kitten, 12 weeks old. Blue-coated tuxedo with thick fur and hazel eyes. ♥ Rambunctious & frisky boy! LOVES to play & run about (needs toys, kitty companions or some kind of constant stimulation). Active households are his perfect cup of tea! Maksim is extremely vocal and knows how to talk (meow) back when spoken to. :) ♥ Maksim LOVES being carried over his people's shoulders (he stays put like a parrot and simply enjoys the view he gets). Maksim will also run right over to your lap whenever he's spooked by something (still doesn't stop him from exploring every nook and cranny he can find!) ♥ This boy can be a little demanding when he taps into his manja-moods (asking for cheek-rubs and strokes while he snoozes off). Mind you he has a VERY loud purr! ♥ Maksim is healthy, has been de-wormed (once) and given Frontline (flea medication). Already clever with the litter-box and able to eat kibbles independently. ***[IMPORTANT] Note for potential adopters*** - Whenever alone, Maksim tries to \"play\" with our fingers during stroking, and sometimes nips. This is only play-biting and a simple \"shh!\" makes him stop immediately. :) He is a very smart kitten and for this reason, experienced cat owners are preferred. - Maksim must be kept INDOORS at all times and NEUTERED at the right age (adopters who already practice neutering their cats preferred). - Premium food feeding only (no Whiskas, Friskies etc). Please drop me an email or call if you feel that you may be just the right person for this boy. Thank you!\n",

      "This sweet girl we called Frigga, was found wandering outside my house area on Saturday (). We spotted one huge open wound that a fly just went there to settle itself and didnt come out.. It was a late evening, on a saturday, most vet around our area already closed, so we took her to MediVet Hospital in Jalan Tun Razak. Doctor found about 4 maggot wounds on her, one near her left ear, 3 near the tail area. She had to be hospitalized for 4 days, did blood work as well as viral test, which she was negative for. She was anemic and her heart was weakened due to the prolonged infection. She even had to be force-fed with the IV on. Now she is so much more energetic with good appetite! Her suturing was done as well, medication is on for 7 days prior to her discharge on the 19th. Frigga is a very manja girl, who is quite obedient for a stray..she even waited for you to walk first when you walk her. She gets a little anxious when you leave her on her own, but as long as she can roam around the house she does not whine so much. But all in all, she is really a lovable sweet girl..I cant keep her because my father doesnt tolerate dogs. It was fortunate enough after much talk from my mom he agreed to let her stay for 10 days. PLEASE, anyone who would want a manja/loving dog who is playful and sweet, give her a new permanent home. She is friendly with people and even my cats.. :)\n",
